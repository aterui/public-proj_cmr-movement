  abstract = {Theory predicts that intraspecific competition should be stronger than interspecific competition for any pair of stably coexisting species, yet previous literature reviews found little support for this pattern. We screened over 5400 publications and identified 39 studies that quantified phenomenological intraspecific and interspecific interactions in terrestrial plant communities. Of the 67\% of species pairs in which both intra- and interspecific effects were negative (competitive), intraspecific competition was, on average, four to five-fold stronger than interspecific competition. Of the remaining pairs, 93\% featured intraspecific competition and interspecific facilitation, a situation that stabilises coexistence. The difference between intra- and interspecific effects tended to be larger in observational than experimental data sets, in field than greenhouse studies, and in studies that quantified population growth over the full life cycle rather than single fitness components. Our results imply that processes promoting stable coexistence at local scales are common and consequential across terrestrial plant communities.},

  abstract = {Mark--recapture studies generate biased, or distance-weighted, movement data because short distances are sampled more frequently than long distances. Using models and field data, we determined how study design affects distance weighting and the movement distributions of stream fishes. We first modeled distance weighting as a function of recapture section length in an unbranching stream. The addition of an unsampled tributary to one of these models substantially increased distance weighting by decreasing the percentage of upstream distances that were sampled. Similarly, the presence of multiple tributaries in the field study resulted in severe bias. However, increasing recapture section length strongly affected distance weighting in both the model and the field study, producing a zone where the number of fish moving could be estimated with little bias. Subsampled data from the field study indicated that longer median (three of three species) and maximum distances (two of three species) can be detected by increasing the length of the recapture section. The effect was extreme for bluehead chub Nocomis leptocephalus, a highly mobile species, which exhibited a longer median distance (133 m versus 60 m), a longer maximum distance (1,144 m versus 708 m), and a distance distribution that differed in shape when the full (4,123-m recapture section) and subsampled (1,978-m recapture section) data sets were compared. Correction factors that adjust the observed number of movements to undersampled distances upwards and those to oversampled distances downwards could not mitigate the distance weighting imposed by the shorter recapture section. Future studies should identify the spatial scale over which movements can be accurately measured before data are collected. Increasing recapture section length a priori is far superior to using post hoc correction factors to reduce the influence of distance weighting on observed distributions. Implementing these strategies will be especially important in stream networks where fish can follow multiple pathways out of the recapture section.},

  abstract = {Identifying factors that influence fish movement is a key step in predicting how populations respond to environmental change. Using mark-recapture (four species) and trap capture (eight species) data, we examined relationships between three attributes of movement and 15 ecological variables. The probability of emigrating from a reach was positively related to intermittency (one species) and body size (one species) and negatively related to distance from the mainstem creek (two species) and habitat complexity (one species). The number of fish moving upstream through traps was positively related to increases in flow (five species), day length (three species), and water temperature (two species); the number moving through downstream traps was positively associated with increases in flow (three species). Distance moved was greater for fish moving through unsuitable reaches (one species). Floods have a pervasive effect on fish movement, and human activities that affect flows will have widespread implications. The importance of other factors varies interspecifically, which may translate into variation in persistence and colonization rates. For example, species that exhibit reach fidelity in complex habitats may increase movement if habitats are homogenized. These species may suffer population declines because of the cost of increased movement and may ultimately be replaced by ecological generalists. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The Fundulus notatus species complex includes several species with similar ecological niches that exhibit broadly overlapping ranges. We conducted a mark--recapture study on two of the most widely distributed members of this species complex to improve our understanding of their movement and habitat use. A population of F. notatus was studied between June and August of 2008 and 2009 in Cahokia Creek, a small tributary of the Mississippi River in Illinois, along with a parallel study of Fundulus olivaceus between May and July of 2009 in Big Creek, a tributary of the Pascagoula River in Mississippi. Fish were recaptured approximately weekly, and habitat variables were measured. Estimated daily movement rates varied significantly both between locations and between years. Fundulus olivaceus in Big Creek moved {$<$}1 m per day, while F. notatus in Cahokia Creek in 2009 moved nearly 23 m per day. The distribution of movements was strongly leptokurtic in all three data sets. Differences in movement rates were attributed to significant differences in population size and habitat characteristics. Our data did not support the hypothesis that populations consist of distinct mobile and resident components. Instead, individual fish went through periods of little or no movement followed by extensive movement (consistent with the home range shift model of fish movement). We discuss the implications these results have for contact zone dynamics between these two species.},

  abstract = {I investigate the influence of dispersal strategies on intraguild prey and predators (competing species that prey on each other). I find an asymmetry between the intraguild prey and predator in their responses to each other's dispersal. The intraguild predator's dispersal strategy and dispersal behavior have strong effects on the intraguild prey's abundance pattern, but the intraguild prey's dispersal strategy and behavior have little or no effect on the intraguild predator's abundance pattern. This asymmetry arises from the different constraints faced by the two species: the intraguild prey has to acquire resources while avoiding predation, but the intraguild predator only has to acquire resources. It leads to puzzling distribution patterns: when the intraguild prey and predator both move away from areas of high density, they become aggregated to high-density habitats, but when they both move toward areas of high resource productivity, they become segregated to resource-poor and resource-rich habitats. Aggregation is more likely when dispersal is random or less optimal, and segregation is more likely as dispersal becomes more optimal. The crucial implication is that trophic constraints dictate the fitness benefits of using dispersal strategies to sample environmental heterogeneity. A strategy that affords greater benefits to an intraguild predator can lead to a more optimal outcome for both the intraguild predator and prey than a strategy that affords greater benefits to an intraguild prey.},

Fish inhabiting those sections of the stream with greater depth, slower current and more cover had a lower movement rate than fish occupying shallower, exposed sections. The restricted movement of B. haasi could increase the survival of fish by increasing the probability of staying in the remaining pools during summer dry-out, and may therefore be of adaptive significance.},

Among the 28 remaining tributaries, classified as adventitious (lst--3rd order) or ordered (4th--5th order), we evaluated fish communities using the Jaccard coefficient of similarity, a cluster analysis, and a Venn diagram. Adventitious tributaries shared 82\% of their total faunal complement with ordered tributaries and 29\% with the mainstem, while 70\% of the ordered ichthyofauna was common to the mainstem. The ichthyofauna of the adventitious tributary network was more distinct and isolated from the mainstem than that of ordered tributaries.

  abstract = {Quantification of rates and patterns of community dynamics is central for understanding the organization and function of ecosystems. These insights may support a greater empirical understanding of ecological resilience, and the application of resilience concepts toward ecosystem management. Distinct types of dynamics in natural communities can be used to interpret and apply resilience concepts, but quantitative methods that can systematically distinguish among them are needed. We develop a quantitative method to analyze long-term records of plant community dynamics using principles of movement ecology. We analyzed dissimilarity of species composition through time with linear and nonlinear statistical models to assign community change to four classes of movement trajectories. Compositional change in each sampled plot through time was classified into four classes, stability, abrupt nonlinear change, transient reversible change, and gradual linear drift, each representing a different aspect of ecological resilience. These competing models were evaluated based on estimated coefficients, goodness of fit, and parsimony. We tested our method's accuracy and robustness through simulations, or the ability to distinguish among trajectories and classify them correctly. We simulated 16,000 trajectories of four types, of which 94--100\% were correctly classified. Next, we analyzed 13 long-term vegetation records from North American grasslands (annual grasslands with warm-season and cool-season communities, shortgrass, mixedgrass, and tallgrass prairies, and sagebrush steppe), and a record of primary succession at Mt. St. Helens volcano. Collectively, we analyzed 14,647 observations from 775 plots, between 1915 and 2012. Dynamics could be reliably assigned for 705 plots (91\%), and overall statistical fit was high (goodness of fit, 0.77 {\textpm} 0.15 SD). Among the perennial grasslands, stability was most common (44\% of all plots), followed by gradual linear (22\%), abrupt nonlinear (17\%), and reversible (6\%) change. Among annual grasslands, abrupt nonlinear shifts (33\%) were more common in the warm-season community than in the cool-season (20\%). As expected, abrupt nonlinear change was common during primary succession (51\%) while reversible change was rare (3\%). Generally, reversible dynamics often required 2--3 decades. Analysis of long-term community change, or trajectories, with principles of movement ecology provides a quantitative basis to compare and interpret ecological resilience within and among ecosystems.},

Despite the importance of species interactions in determining fitness, a quantitative synthesis of how they affect dispersal is lacking. We present a meta-analysis asking (i) whether the interaction experienced and/or perceived by a focal species (detrimental interaction with predators, competitors, parasites or beneficial interaction with resources, hosts, mutualists) affects its dispersal; and (ii) how the species' ecological and biological background affects the direction and strength of this interaction-dependent dispersal. After a systematic search focusing on actively dispersing species, we extracted 397 effect sizes from 118 empirical studies encompassing 221 species pairs; arthropods were best represented, followed by vertebrates, protists and others. Detrimental species interactions increased the focal species' dispersal (adjusted effect: 0.33 [0.06, 0.60]), while beneficial interactions decreased it (-0.55 [-0.92, -0.17]). The effect depended on the dispersal phase, with detrimental interactors having opposite impacts on emigration and transience. Interaction-dependent dispersal was negatively related to species' interaction strength, and depended on the global community composition, with cues of presence having stronger effects than the presence of the interactor and the ecological complexity of the community. Our work demonstrates the importance of interspecific interactions on dispersal plasticity, with consequences for metacommunity dynamics.

  abstract = {Walleye (Sander vitreus; WAE) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens; YEP; collectively percids) are freshwater fishes threatened by multiple stressors, including aquatic invasive species. Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha; ZM) and spiny water fleas (Bythotrephes cederstr{\"o}mii; SWF) are aquatic invasive species that reduce pelagic zooplankton biomass, an important food resource for both age-0 percids and the prey fish of adult percids. Both percid species are generalist consumers, and it is unknown how they respond to reduced pelagic energy resources associated with invasions. We examined pelagic and littoral energy use in percids from nine large north temperate lakes which vary in invasion status. We sampled adult and age-0 percids from each lake in 2017 or 2018 and analyzed muscle tissue for {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N isotope ratios. We characterized isotope baselines with littoral and pelagic invertebrates to allow cross-lake comparisons. We estimated the proportion pelagic reliance using Bayesian mixing models and determined the variance contribution of ZM and SWF presence to estimates using model comparison. Pelagic reliance of percids sampled from ZM-invaded lakes was consistently lower than uninvaded lakes, while pelagic reliance of percids sampled from SWF-invaded lakes was greater than uninvaded lakes, although neither effect was statistically distinguishable from zero. Model comparison indicated pelagic reliance of adult WAE, age-0 WAE, and age-0 YEP was influenced by ZM presence, while pelagic reliance of adult YEP was influenced by SWF presence. If percid populations persistently rely on pelagic resources, despite those resources being reduced, there may be negative consequences to growth, survival, or recruitment.},

We carry out assembly experiments (`actions', here, random combinations of species additions) potentially in multiple environments, wait, and measure abundance outcomes. We then train a model to predict outcomes of novel actions or prioritise actions that would yield the most desirable outcomes. Across 10 single- and multi-environment datasets, when trained on 89 randomly selected actions, LOVE predicts outcomes with 0.5\%--3.4\% mean error, and prioritises actions for maximising richness, maximising abundance, or removing unwanted species, with 94\%--99\% mean true positive rate and 10\%--84\% mean true negative rate across tasks. LOVE complements existing mechanism-first approaches for community ecology and may help address numerous applied challenges.},

  abstract = {Objective Barriers to movement negatively affect population vital rates of riverine fishes that rely on connected migratory routes to complete components of their life cycle, such as reproduction and recruitment. In the southwestern United States, decades of water diversion, construction of large impoundments, and loss of floodplain habitats have all contributed to highly fragmented riverscapes. A capture--translocation strategy was implemented for Razorback Suckers Xyrauchen texanus in the San Juan River to mitigate the negative effects of two barriers while precluding the upstream movement of nonnative species. We hypothesized that translocated individuals would remain upstream of barriers during the spawning season and that aggregations of translocated Razorback Suckers would be identified upstream in spawning habitats. Methods We used radiotelemetry to assess movement of Razorback Suckers after translocation above the two barriers. We deployed fixed remote radio receivers to determine residency time above each barrier and conducted mobile telemetry surveys to monitor upstream destinations after translocation. Result Although most Razorback Suckers returned downstream of barriers within 2 months of translocation, we provide evidence that most individuals remained upstream long enough to successfully spawn. After translocation above the Piute Farms Waterfall, 80\% of individuals remained upstream for 26 days in 2020 and for 23 days in 2021. Further upstream (307 km), at a weir operated by the Public Service Company of New Mexico, 80\% of translocated individuals remained above the barrier for 37 days in 2021 and for 25 days in 2022. After fish translocation above both barriers, we observed upstream movements ranging from 2 to 262 km and we detected distinct aggregations within the expected spawning season. Conclusion Although translocation efforts seasonally reconnect migratory routes for a proportion of the population and may increase spawning potential, other conservation actions are likely still needed to improve recruitment conditions for juvenile fish.},

Board Can. 34: 1922--1935) bioenergetics model and field derived estimates of growth and consumption rates to estimate the quantity of energy allocated to activity by 28 combinations of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) age class and population. Activity costs among populations ranged from 0 to 40\% of the perch bioenergetics budget. We further evaluated the influence of activity rates on the food consumption estimates predicted by the Kitchell et al. model and the model proposed by Kerr (Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 39: 371--379). As suggested by Kerr, activity costs increased as food consumption increased. However, we found no significant relationship between predicted and observed food consumption estimates for either model. The magnitude of, and the among-population variance in, the quantity of energy allocated to activity is consistent with our hypothesis that this component of the bioenergetics budget of fishes has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the explanation of inter-population differences in perch growth and, by extension, to the variance in growth of other actively foraging fish species.},

Interpretation of PIT tag detections, however, can be confounded by the presence of ghost tags, tags liberated when a fish dies. We used a combination of mobile antenna surveys, stationary antenna detections, and multistate mark--recapture modeling to assess the abundance and fate of ghost tags in a coastal California watershed. Accumulation of ghost tags from released hatchery-origin coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolts was substantial during California's recent drought, with 2224 ghost tags identified during mobile reader surveys. Between surveys, PIT tags moved downstream a median distance of 346 m and a maximum distance of 1982 m. Stationary antenna array detections indicated that these movements occurred during high-flow events, concurrent with live fish movement. The multistate model estimated that, during winter, approximately 40\% of tags were buried in the substrate beyond the read range of mobile readers. Failure to account for transport and burial dynamics of ghost tags can lead to biased estimates of fish abundance, survival, and movement. (English)},

Not all individuals from a population disperse, and individual heterogeneity in costs and benefits of dispersal underlie phenotype-dependent dispersal strategies. Dispersing phenotypes are always expected to maximize their fitness by adaptive decision making relative to the alternative strategy of remaining philopatric. While this first principle is well acknowledged in theoretical ecology, empirical verification is extremely difficult, due to a plethora of experimental constraints. We studied fitness prospects of dispersal in a game theoretical context using the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a model species. We demonstrate that dispersing phenotypes represent those individuals able to maximize their fitness in a novel, less populated environment reached after dispersal. In contrast to philopatric phenotypes, successful dispersers performed better in a low density post-dispersal context, but worse in a high density philopatric context. They increased fitness about 450\% relative to the strategy of remaining philopatric. The optimization of phenotype-dependent dispersal, thus, maximizes fitness.},

  abstract = {Dispersal plays a pivotal role in the eco-evolutionary dynamics of spatially structured populations, communities and ecosystems. As an individual-based trait, dispersal is subject to both plasticity and evolution. Its dependence on conditions and context is well understood within single-species metapopulations. However, species do not exist in isolation; they interact locally through various horizontal and vertical interactions. While the significance of species interactions is recognized for species coexistence and food web functioning, our understanding of their influence on regional dynamics, such as their impact on spatial dynamics in metacommunities and meta-food webs, remains limited. Building upon insights from behavioural and community ecology, we aim to elucidate biodiversity as both a driver and an outcome of connectivity. By synthesizing conceptual, theoretical and empirical contributions from global experts in the field, we seek to explore how a more mechanistic understanding of diversity--dispersal relationships influences the distribution of species in spatially and temporally changing environments. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering interspecific interactions as drivers of dispersal, thus reshaping our understanding of fundamental dynamics including species coexistence and the emergent dynamics of metacommunities and meta-ecosystems. We envision that this initiative will pave the way for advanced forecasting approaches to understanding biodiversity dynamics under the pressures of global change.

As a result, all food web models require some unavoidable simplifications because of limited data availability, whether temporally, spatially, or taxonomically. Large databases of published trophic interactions have made this process somewhat easier, but knowledge gaps persist. We combine the use of databases with extensive field surveys, including gut-content analysis, to generate a food web for Lake George, NY. Including aquatic plants, phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish, our analysis identified 279 genera in the lake involved in 1910 interactions. After removing genera with no identified interactions or improbable interactions and grouping some genera into higher categories, the food web included 49 nodes with 484 interactions among them. The network structure of the inferred Lake George food web exhibits several common patterns such as relatively few trophic levels and the prevalence of tritrophic chains. Our results suggest that constructing food webs from databases provides a useful first step to determine topology. However, in situ sampling allowed us to account for additional interactions, as only 50 of the 106 directly observed interactions between fish and their prey were also found in published databases. Finally, we highlight the need to focus on developing a better understanding of herbivory in lakes, as species interactions among the diverse plankton and macroinvertebrate populations are not well known.},

Despite the focus of much theoretical research, simplistic assumptions regarding the dispersal process are still made. Dispersal is usually regarded as an unconditional process although in many cases fitness gains of dispersal are dependent on environmental factors and individual state. Condition-dependent dispersal strategies will often be superior to unconditional, fixed strategies. In addition, dispersal is often collapsed into a single parameter, despite it being a process composed of three interdependent stages: emigration, inter-patch movement and immigration, each of which may display different condition dependencies. Empirical studies have investigated correlates of these stages, emigration in particular, providing evidence for the prevalence of conditional dispersal strategies. Ill-defined use of the term `dispersal', for movement across many different spatial scales, further hinders making general conclusions and relating movement correlates to consequences at the population level. Logistical difficulties preclude a detailed study of dispersal for many species, however incorporating unrealistic dispersal assumptions in spatial population models may yield inaccurate and costly predictions. Further studies are necessary to explore the importance of incorporating specific condition-dependent dispersal strategies for evolutionary and population dynamic predictions.},

  abstract = {All communities vary through time. This variability originates from both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. Intrinsic sources are due to actions of organisms in a community, i.e., population dynamics and species interactions, while extrinsic variability is variability created by elements of habitat or environmental change. There is a growing appreciation that these two sources may interact, producing patterns of community variability that cannot be predicted or explained by focusing on a single source. We performed a field experiment that simultaneously manipulated trophic structure (intrinsic) and habitat heterogeneity (extrinsic) in order to examine the interaction between sources of variability in a South Carolina (USA) stream macroinvertebrate community. To manipulate trophic structure, we experimentally altered local abundances of crayfish which are keystone species and ecosystem engineers, while our manipulation of habitat was to alter stream substrate heterogeneity. We focused on two types of community variability as responses to our manipulations: aggregate variability (i.e., variability of summed species) and compositional variability (i.e., variability in relative abundances of species) by monitoring community composition through a 10-week experiment. We found that community dynamics shifted from patterns in variability indicative of synchrony (high aggregate variability + low compositional) to variability indicative of compensation (low aggregate variability + high compositional) along a gradient of increasing habitat heterogeneity. However, the shift in community dynamics only occurred when crayfish were present in the community. Supporting evidence from the experiment suggested that sediment engineering effects of crayfish acted as a community-wide perturbation in low-heterogeneity habitat creating synchronous dynamics. However, in high-heterogeneity enclosures, crayfish effects were moderated by refugia provided by a more complex substratum. The switch from synchronous to compensatory dynamics is significant since compensation stabilizes aggregate community properties and ecosystem functions while synchrony frequently exacerbates aggregate variability. Results from this experiment demonstrate that an interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variability can alter community dynamics and that such an alteration does not occur in the absence of an interaction.},

  abstract = {Animal movement and resource use are essential considerations for effective environmental management, but they are challenging to quantify in expansive natural ecosystems such as oceans. We used a novel combination of fish tracking with expansive acoustic telemetry networks, stable isotope analysis and integrated modelling techniques to characterize the spatial and trophic ecology of a marine fish species, permit Trachinotus falcatus, and to address specific resource management needs in the Florida Keys. Tracking-based movement patterns indicated that permit remained primarily within the designated fisheries management unit (92\% of individuals), but they moved frequently among distinct habitat types and fisheries. Movement metrics from 109 individuals were integrated into Bayesian isotope mixing models, revealing variable reliance on seagrass- versus offshore/pelagic-based energy channels amongst individuals. Variance was driven mainly by fish habitat use and home range size (km2). A telemetry-based regional isoscape, informed by individual-level estimates of resource use (\% seagrass reliance; median = 70\%, 29\%--100\% range), illustrated connectivity among habitats and fisheries. Specifically, seagrass flats were highly connected with the Florida reef tract, with frequent movements between these habitat types and a high reliance on seagrass-based prey. There was a distinction between these fish and those occupying artificial reefs, with the latter showing high use of pelagic/offshore (i.e. planktonic) energy channels. Synthesis and applications. This study used a novel combination of telemetry, stable isotope analysis and integrated modelling techniques to identify two distinct ecotypes of a nearshore fish species, permit, in the Florida Keys. Of the two ecotypes, nearshore Florida Keys permit support multiple valuable fisheries; for these fish management should prioritize conservation of seagrass flats as a key permit food source, as well as fisheries protection measures at spawning sites on the Florida reef tract. This study highlights the capacity for integrated telemetry-isotope models to provide key insights into animal ecology that has direct implications for applied environmental management.},

We examined the relation between boldness (taken as the time to emerge from a shelter and explore a novel environment) and body size in eight populations of the poeciliid Brachyraphis episcopi originating from sites upstream and downstream of waterfalls in four rivers that run into the Panama Canal. The relation between body size and time to emerge from a shelter was positive, with larger fish taking longer to emerge. This relation differed between downstream and upstream sites, being significant in the upstream populations only. These results are best explained by a metabolic hypothesis whereby juvenile fish are compelled to emerge earlier in order to resume feeding. In the downstream sites this effect was slightly offset by the relatively greater predation threat for smaller fish, such that they delayed their emergence from cover. We discuss the underlying importance of variation in boldness and its effects on other behavioural and life history traits.},

Ecology of Freshwater Fish 2010: 19: 466--476. {\copyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons A/S Abstract -- Habitat complexity is a key driver of food web dynamics because physical structure dictates resource availability to a community. Changes in fish diversity can also alter trophic interactions and energy pathways in food webs. Few studies have examined the direct, indirect, and interactive effects of biodiversity and habitat complexity on fish production. We explored the effects of habitat complexity (simulated vegetation), sunfish diversity (intra- vs. inter-specific sunfish), and their interaction using a mesocosm experiment. Total fish production was examined across two levels of habitat complexity (low: 161 strands m-2 and high: 714 strands m-2) and two sunfish diversity treatments: bluegill only (Lepomis macrochirus) and bluegill, redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), and green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) combination. We also measured changes in total phosphorus, phytoplankton, periphyton, and invertebrates to explain patterns in fish production. Bluegill and total fish production were unaffected by the sunfish treatments. Habitat complexity had a large influence on food web structure by shifting primary productivity from pelagic to a more littoral pathway in the high habitat treatments. Periphyton was higher with dense vegetation, leading to reductions in total phosphorus, phytoplankton, cladoceran abundance and fish biomass. In tanks with low vegetation, bluegill exhibited increased growth. Habitat complexity can alter energy flow through food webs ultimately influencing higher trophic levels. The lack of an effect of sunfish diversity on fish production does not imply that conserving biodiversity is unimportant; rather, we suggest that understanding the context in which biodiversity is important to food web dynamics is critical to conservation planning.},

Here, we investigated the generality of a novel type of NDD mechanism that operates through the mutualistic interactions of frugivory and seed dispersal among fruit-eating birds and plants. By sampling community-wide frugivory interactions at high spatial and temporal resolution in Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Peru, Brazil and Argentina, we evaluated whether interaction frequencies between birds and fruit resources occurred more often (selection), as expected, or below expectations (under-utilization) set by the relative fruit abundance of the fruit resources of each plant species. Our models considered the influence of temporal scales of fruit availability and bird phylogeny and diets, revealing that NDD characterizes frugivory across communities. Irrespective of taxa or dietary guild, birds tended to select fruits of plant species that were proportionally rare in their communities, or that became rare following phenological fluctuations, while they mostly under-utilized abundant fruit resources. Our results demonstrate that negative density-dependence in frugivore--plant interactions provides a strong equalizing mechanism for the dispersal processes of fleshy-fruited plant species in temperate and tropical communities, likely contributing to building and sustaining plant diversity.

Weekly survival in stream enclosures was assessed for a total of 350 tagged individuals and 311 control (untagged) fish (39--101 mm TL; median = 65 mm TL) belonging to six species (Bluehead Chub Nocomis leptocephalus, Creek Chub Semotilus atromaculatus, Yellowfin Shiner Notropis lutipinnis, Mottled Sculpin Cottus bairdii, Northern Hog Sucker Hypentelium nigricans, and Striped Jumprock Moxostoma rupiscartes). Weekly survival rates ranged from 93.3\% to 100\% among species, with Yellowfin Shiners experiencing the lowest survival rate. Only 2 of the 337 surviving tagged individuals lost their tags (0.6\% tag loss). Logistic regression indicated that species and body length were statistically significant predictors of survival and tag retention. Odds ratios indicated that tagged fish were 1.718 times less likely to survive than control fish, but the tagging effect was not statistically significant. Bimonthly survival was estimated by conducting a mark--recapture study from September 2015 to May 2016, which involved tagging 1,413 unique individuals of Bluehead Chub (45--75 mm TL) in a 520-m stream section and 431 individuals of Mottled Sculpin (45--75 mm) in another 740-m section. Bayesian state--space analysis of Cormack--Jolly--Seber models indicated that apparent survival did not differ between newly tagged and previously tagged (i.e., recaptured) individuals in any sampling interval, suggesting that the acute and chronic effects of tagging did not differ. Mean bimonthly apparent survival rate was 0.76 (95\% credible interval = 0.64--0.86) for Bluehead Chub and 0.74 (95\% credible interval = 0.59--0.88) for Mottled Sculpin. Our results indicate that PIT tags can be successfully applied to study the ecology and life history of small-bodied, nongame fish species, although caution should be exercised when selecting the species and body sizes to be tagged.},

Increased nutrient inputs, channelization and reduced riparian habitat both upstream and locally contribute to the degradation of stream ecosystems and their function. Here, we examine stream food webs in watersheds that feed into Lake Erie to determine the effects of agricultural land cover on major food web energy pathways and trophic structure. Given that higher agricultural intensity can increase nutrient runoff and reduce the riparian zone and litter in-fall into streams, we predicted that generalist fish would derive less energy from the terrestrial pathway and become more omnivorous. Consistent with these predictions, we show that both mean terrestrial energy use and trophic position of the resident top consumer, creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), decrease with local agricultural intensity but not with watershed-level agriculture intensity. These findings suggest that local riparian buffers can maintain trophic structure even in the face of high whole-watershed agricultural intensity.},

  abstract = {Harsh conditions (e.g., mortality and stress) reduce population growth rates directly; secondarily, they may reduce the intensity of interactions between organisms. Near-exclusive focus on the secondary effect of these forms of harshness has led ecologists to believe that they reduce the importance of ecological interactions, such as competition, and favor coexistence of even ecologically very similar species. By examining both the costs and the benefits, we show that harshness alone does not lessen the importance of species interactions or limit their role in community structure. Species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely. Fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., disturbance, seasonal change, and weather variation) also have been regarded as decreasing species interactions and favoring coexistence, but we argue that coexistence can only be favored when fluctuations create spatial or temporal niche opportunities. We argue that important diversity-promoting roles for harsh and fluctuating conditions depend on deviations from the assumptions of additive effects and linear dependencies most commonly found in ecological models. Such considerations imply strong roles for species interactions in the diversity of a community.}

However, all patches within a metapopulation are, to some extent, exchanging individuals due to dispersal, even those that are already occupied. This phenomenon leads to a re-enforcement of the extant local populations (the rescue effect). This chapter focuses on condition-dependent dispersal because it is important to take condition dependence into account to make realistic predictions about the dispersal evolution and its consequences. In more recent developments of metapopulation theory, dispersal has been considered to be a function of the density in the patch of departure and other features such as the patch size and the distance between patches. In addition to these attempts, dispersal was largely considered to be unconditional of the status of the individual, the potential donor, and recipient patches, as well as the matrix between patches.},

The assumption that trophic coupling is common remains largely untested, despite evidence that individual behaviors might limit trophic coupling. We used stable isotope data from common bottlenose dolphins across the Gulf of Mexico to determine if these apex predators coupled estuarine and adjacent, nearshore marine habitats. {$\delta$}13C values differed among the sites, likely driven by environmental factors that varied at each site, such as freshwater input and seagrass cover. Within most sites, {$\delta$}13C values differed such that dolphins sampled in the upper reaches of embayments had values indicative of estuarine habitats while those sampled outside or in lower reaches of embayments had values indicative of marine habitats. {$\delta$}15N values were more similar among and within sites than {$\delta$}13C values. Data from multiple tissues within individuals corroborated that most dolphins consistently used a narrow range of habitats but fed at similar trophic levels in estuarine and marine habitats. Because these dolphins exhibited individual habitat specialization, they likely do not contribute to trophic coupling between estuarine and adjacent marine habitats at a regional scale, suggesting that not all mobile, apex predators trophically couple adjacent habitats.},

We measured functional features of the skull and performed principal components analysis on species' values for these variables. To assess the role of piscivory on morphological diversification, we compared the fit of several models of evolution for each principal component (PC), where model parameters were allowed to vary between lineages that differed in degree of piscivory. According to the best-fitting model, two adaptive peaks influenced PC 1 evolution, one peak shared between highly and moderately piscivorous lineages and another for nonpiscivores. Brownian motion better fit PCs 2, 3, and 4, but the best Brownian models infer a slow rate of PC 2 evolution shared among all piscivores and a uniquely slow rate of PC 4 evolution in highly piscivorous lineages. These results suggest that piscivory limits feeding morphology diversification, but this effect is most severe in lineages that exhibit an extreme form of this diet.},

  abstract = {Enhancing our understanding of fish dispersal is central to the success of modern-\-day conservation efforts in freshwater ecosystems. However, methods seeking to estimate dispersal are diverse; ranging from direct estimation of individual movements, computation of dispersal kernels, to indirect assessment using measures of gene flow across riverscapes. An important question is whether results from these different approaches provide a consistent picture of the spatial scales of dispersal. Here, we performed a review and meta-\-analysis of the literature reporting both individual movements and genetic data to characterize patterns of dispersal for riverine fishes globally. Across all the studies considered (Ndirect = 206; Nindirect = 205), our results suggest restricted magnitudes of dispersal for riverine fishes, but highlight a large heterogeneity among species, taxonomic orders and geographies. For instance, we found that the maximum parent--offspring dispersal distances varied from 69 m to 1,086 km (median = 12 km; Nspecies = 107), whereas the dispersal spread derived from isolation-\-by-\-distance slopes ({$\sigma$}IBD) from genetic data ranged from 19 m to 250 km (median = 1 km; Nspecies = 56). Comparisons of species-\-specific values also revealed significant and positive relationships between direct and indirect estimates of dispersal distances, indicating that organismal movement ability often translates into effective transmission of genes. Finally, this global overview pointed to important geographic and taxonomic disparities in the study of dispersal for riverine fishes. We thus encourage researchers to broaden the taxonomic and geographical scope of future investigations and identify emerging research frontiers where new scientific efforts are needed.},

  abstract = {Movement of fishes in the aquatic realm is fundamental to their ecology and survival. Movement can be driven by a variety of biological, physiological and environmental factors occurring across all spatial and temporal scales. The intrinsic capacity of movement to impact fish individually (e.g., foraging) with potential knock-on effects throughout the ecosystem (e.g., food web dynamics) has garnered considerable interest in the field of movement ecology. The advancement of technology in recent decades, in combination with ever-growing threats to freshwater and marine systems, has further spurred empirical research and theoretical considerations. Given the rapid expansion within the field of movement ecology and its significant role in informing management and conservation efforts, a contemporary and multidisciplinary review about the various components influencing movement is outstanding. Using an established conceptual framework for movement ecology as a guide (i.e., Nathan et al., 2008: 19052), we synthesized the environmental and individual factors that affect the movement of fishes. Specifically, internal (e.g., energy acquisition, endocrinology, and homeostasis) and external (biotic and abiotic) environmental elements are discussed, as well as the different processes that influence individual-level (or population) decisions, such as navigation cues, motion capacity, propagation characteristics and group behaviours. In addition to environmental drivers and individual movement factors, we also explored how associated strategies help survival by optimizing physiological and other biological states. Next, we identified how movement ecology is increasingly being incorporated into management and conservation by highlighting the inherent benefits that spatio-temporal fish behaviour imbues into policy, regulatory, and remediation planning. Finally, we considered the future of movement ecology by evaluating ongoing technological innovations and both the challenges and opportunities that these advancements create for scientists and managers. As aquatic ecosystems continue to face alarming climate (and other human-driven) issues that impact animal movements, the comprehensive and multidisciplinary assessment of movement ecology will be instrumental in developing plans to guide research and promote sustainability measures for aquatic resources.},

The majority of the data sets were structured by species-sorting dynamics (SS), followed by a combination of SS and mass-effect dynamics. While neutral processes were the only structuring process in 8\% of the collected natural communities, disregarding neutral dispersal processes would result in missing important patterns in 37\% of the studied communities.

We examined the movement patterns of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) in the Arima river of Trinidad and predicted that sexual asymmetry in reproductive investment would result in male-biased movement. Since male guppies maximize their reproductive success by mating with as many different females as possible, there should be strong selection for males to move in search of mates. In agreement with our prediction, the percentage of fish that emigrated from release pools was higher for males than females (27.3\% vs. 6.9\%, respectively). Sex ratio was highly variable among pools and may influence a male's decision to emigrate or continue moving. We also detected a positive relationship between body length and the probability of emigration for males and a significant bias for upstream movement by males. Among the few females that did emigrate, a positive correlation was observed between body length and distance moved. Sex-biased movement appears to be related to mating systems in fishes, but the evidence is very limited. Given the implications for ecology, evolution, and conservation, future studies should explicitly address the influence of sex and mating systems on movement patterns.},

Recently, this `Restricted Movement Paradigm' has been challenged and there is currently a need for tests of the home range concept as a theoretical basis for describing the movements of riverine fish. In this paper, I describe a radio-tracking study of golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and carp (Cyprinus carpio) in the Broken River, Australia that aims to assess the home range concept as a means of describing the movements of these species. 2 A random movement analysis and a translocation experiment were conducted to test for site fidelity and home range occupation. Both golden perch and carp exhibited strong site fidelity and occupied restricted home ranges. Carp had larger total home ranges than golden perch, and both species had areas of concentrated use (core areas) within the home range. 3 Several golden perch and carp exhibited shifts in the locations of their home ranges during the study. To incorporate such shifts into a theoretical framework, a `home range shift' conceptual model is proposed and the need to consider the temporal stability of site fidelity when describing home range movements is discussed.},

  abstract = {Information about animal movements has often been inferred from stable isotope analysis (SIA), but is dependent on animals assimilating site-specific isotopic signatures via diet. This potential weakness in ecological interpretation can be overcome by using other investigative tools that provide precise information about individual movement patterns. In this paper, we demonstrate the value of combining SIA with telemetry or mark-recapture data from trapping, electrofishing and remote detection of individuals to study the movement and feeding ecology of fishes in different habitats. In a fjord lake system in Newfoundland, Canada, juvenile Atlantic salmon delayed downstream migration (smolts) or actively moved into a large lake (parr) where they foraged for periods reflecting different life history strategies. In the Miramichi River (New Brunswick, Canada), SIA provided evidence of distinct foraging habitats (tributary versus large river). By tracking fish implanted with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, we distinguished between movements related to foraging versus seeking cool water refugia during high temperature events. Finally, site fidelity and limited mobility of slimy sculpin, a small benthic fish, was established where {$\delta$}13C in muscle tissue showed a progressive enrichment downstream and where a median displacement of {$<$}10~m was estimated for sculpin tagged with PIT tags. Technological improvements have permitted non-destructive tissue sampling of wild fishes for SIA, and the tagging and remote detection of animals smaller than was previously possible. These advancements and the combination of investigative tools promise new insights into animal ecology.},

Trout moved upstream 65-100 km during the spring after ice loss over a protracted 4-month period (April-July). Summer movements were minimal, and habitats were deep pools and runs with cover in the same reaches each year. Trout moved short distances ({$<$}10 km) to spawning areas in the fall (September). Downstream movements were observed for both postspawned and immature trout. By the time of the river freeze-up (January), major movements had ceased and trout wintered in the lower to middle reaches of the main river, with only one trout leaving the river. That fish remained in habitats with salinity less than 5‰ during winter and returned to the river by May. By improving the scale of observation, we identified an apparent mix of tactics related to the use of marine and freshwater environments within this population. Such behavior may have important implications for the ecological and evolutionary significance of mobility and anadromy within the species and the Salmoninae.}

Eastern Oklahoma represents the southwestern edge of the species' range and is where the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation focuses its stream habitat management efforts. Water temperature, streamflow, and habitat differed between Baron Fork Creek (northeast) and the Glover River (southeast) and changed longitudinally within each stream. Smallmouth bass abundance was highest downstream in Baron Fork Creek and lowest downstream in the Glover River. Recruitment was poor and variable in the upstream reaches of both streams and was strong and stable downstream in Baron Fork Creek. The survival of age-1 and older smallmouth bass was higher in Baron Fork Creek than in the Glover River. The relative weights of smallmouth bass were higher in Baron Fork Creek than in the Glover River upstream, and they decreased downstream in Baron Fork Creek. Growth was highest from summer to fall, and relative weights were lowest in spring and highest in summer. Survival was typically lowest from summer to fall. Movement among channel units was highest from fall to winter, and there was evidence that older individuals moved more often. Smallmouth bass used different habitats for overwintering versus spring spawning, and they used most deep habitats in summer and fall. Integrating population dynamics with stream habitat helped to identify habitat management strategies that can best enhance smallmouth bass populations at the edge of their native distribution, where they provide important recreational fishing opportunities to anglers.},

However, the patterns and controls of spatial and temporal variation in aquatic biodiversity in flood-pulsed wetlands are not well understood. We analysed the relationship between variation in hydrological regime and the patterns of aquatic biodiversity in a large pristine flood-pulsed wetland, the Okavango Delta, Botswana. 2. Surveys of water chemistry, diatoms and macroinvertebrates were conducted over the seasonal phases of the flood pulse. Hydrological variables of flood frequency and hydroperiod class were collated from 16 years of satellite images. Multivariate regression trees and generalised least squares regression were used to determine the chief controls of community composition and taxon richness. 3. Hydroperiod class, phase of the flood and conductivity explained 32\% and 43\% of the variation in diatom and invertebrate taxon richness, respectively. There was a negative relationship between hydroperiod class and invertebrate taxon richness on the rising, peak and receding flood, whereas at low flood there was no significant relationship. Multivariate regression tree analysis revealed hydroperiod class, phase of the flood and conductivity as the dominant forces shaping invertebrate and diatom community composition. 4. Seasonal and spatial variation in hydrological conditions are the principal drivers of variation in aquatic biodiversity in flood-pulsed wetlands. In pristine flood-pulsed wetlands, increased productivity caused by the arrival of the flood waters appears to override disturbance and connectivity in shaping taxon richness and community composition. Thus, these data suggest that the maintenance of a rich mosaic of habitats covering a broad range of hydroperiod is the key to preserving aquatic biodiversity and natural ecosystem function in flood-pulsed wetlands.},

  abstract = {Natal dispersal is defined as the movement between the natal range and the site of first breeding and is one of the most important processes in population dynamics. The choice an individual makes between dispersal and philopatry may be condition dependent, influenced by either phenotypic attributes and/or environmental factors. Interindividual variability in dispersal tactics has profound consequences for population dynamics, particularly with respect to metapopulation maintenance. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this variability is thus of primary interest. We investigated the ranging behaviour of 60 juvenile European roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, monitored with GPS collars for 1 year prior to their first reproduction, from 2003 to 2010 in South-West France. Dispersal occurs across a spatial continuum so that dividing individuals into two categories (dispersers vs. philopatric) may lead to information loss. Therefore, to investigate condition-dependent dispersal more accurately, we developed an individual-based measure of dispersal distance, which took into account interindividual variation in ranging behaviour. We assessed the influence of body mass, the degree of habitat heterogeneity and sex on dispersal initiation date, dispersal propensity and distance. The overall population dispersal rate was 0{$\cdot$}34, with a mean {\textpm} SD linear distance between natal and post-dispersal home ranges of 12{$\cdot$}3 {\textpm} 10{$\cdot$}5 km. Dispersal distances followed a classical leptokurtic distribution. We found no sex bias in either dispersal rate or distance. Forest animals dispersed less than those living in more heterogeneous habitats. Heavier individuals dispersed with a higher probability, earlier and further than lighter individuals. Our individual-based standardised dispersal distance increased linearly with body mass, with some suggestion of a body mass threshold of 14 kg under which no individual dispersed. Natal dispersal in roe deer was thus dependent on both phenotypic attributes and environmental context. Our results suggest that population connectivity can be altered by a change in average body condition and is likely higher in the rich and heterogeneous habitats typical of modern day agricultural landscapes.},

Metacommunities of organisms with the ability to fly (i.e. insect groups) showed a weaker imprint of dispersal limitation than passive dispersers with similar body size. In contrast, dispersal movements of vertebrate groups (fish and amphibians) seemed to be mainly confined to local connectivity patterns.

Density can inform on fitness prospects, acting as a cue for either habitat quality, or competition over resources. However, when escaping competition, high local density should only increase emigration if lower-density patches are available elsewhere. Few empirical studies on dispersal have considered the effects of density at the local and landscape scale simultaneously. To explore this, we analyze 5 years of individual-based data from an experimental introduction of wild guppies Poecilia reticulata. Natal dispersal showed a decrease in local density dependence as density at the landscape level increased. Landscape density did not affect dispersal among adults, but local density-dependent dispersal switched from negative (conspecific attraction) to positive (conspecific avoidance), as the colonisation progressed. This study demonstrates that densities at various scales interact to determine dispersal, and suggests that dispersal trade-offs differ across life stages.},

Non-migratory species are the main component of stream fish communities, especially in the Neotropics, but there is little information on the characteristics of their movement. In this capture-recapture study, we describe the individual movement of the armored catfish Rineloricaria aequalicuspis in a stream in southern Brazil. We also assess whether this species displays heterogeneous movement, as well as its degree of mobility and the relationship between individual fish movement and body size and local habitat characteristics. Data on individual fish positions were obtained monthly from November 2018 to March 2019, in ten 20-m stream sections along a 430-m stream stretch. Individual fish were captured by kick sampling and measured, photographed (for later photo-identification), and released back to the stream. The movement frequency distribution was moderately leptokurtic (kurtosis\,=\,3.31), indicating heterogeneous movement with two groups of individuals, stationary and mobile. The maximum movement distances were 248~m and 208~m, downstream and upstream, respectively, while the mean movement distance was 98.6~m. Density of individuals was the main factor affecting the probability of movement, suggesting a role for resource availability and intraspecific interactions. The heterogeneous movement pattern observed for R. aequalicuspis indicates that intra-populational variability in movement behavior occurs in non-migratory stream species, which have been often assumed to be either sedentary or mobile species. We highlight that sedentary behavior should not be assumed a priori for stream fishes, not even for those species usually considered to be of low mobility, as many loricariids.},

  abstract = {Determining the comparative impacts of increased intra- versus inter-specific competition is important in freshwater ecosystems for understanding the ecological changes that can result from activities such as fish stocking events (using alien and/or native fish species), as well as from natural processes that elevate population abundances (e.g. increased annual recruitment success). While increased inter-specific competition can result in slower growth rates and/or reduced population density in the weaker or less abundant competitor, it is important that this is assessed in relation to the impacts of increased intra-specific competition. We tested how the strength of inter-specific competition from a co-existing species varies with abundance, and how this compares with increased intra-specific competition. Fish were the model taxa, as their growth rates strongly correlate with competitive success. Replicated pond mesocosms (150 days) used chub Squalius cephalus in an allopatric control (n = 5; C5) and allopatric treatment (n = 10; C10), and in sympatric treatments (n = 5) with European barbel Barbus barbus (n = 5 (T1), 10 (T2) and 15 (T3)). Treatment effects were tested on fish-specific growth rates (SGRs), and the size and position of the trophic and isotopic niche (stomach contents and stable isotope [SI] analyses respectively). Chub SGRs were significantly higher in C5 versus all other treatments, but did not differ among the other allopatric and sympatric treatments. Chub trophic niche sizes in T1 to T3 were significantly smaller than C5, indicating more specialised diets in the presence of barbel. Chub trophic niche size in C10 was, however, larger than C5 and T1, indicating a shift to a more generalised diet as intra-specific competition increased. As SGRs reduced in treatments, so did the predicted extent of fish SI turnover, with SI data in T1 to T3 not at isotopic equilibrium with their diet in the mesocosms at the experiment's end. Following conversion of fish SI data to represent values at 95\% isotopic turnover, chub isotopic niches also revealed shifts to a more general diet as intra-specific competition increased, but to more specialised diets as inter-specific competition increased. Increased intra- and inter-specific competition impacts on the trophic and isotopic niches were contrasting; both metrics indicated niche constrictions in sympatry but niche expansions in allopatry. Impacts on fish growth were evident from both. These results emphasise that the trophic consequences of competition in freshwater fish can differ between stocking events involving the release of conspecifics or other species, with this having important considerations for how freshwater fish communities are managed for angling exploitation.},

  abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action -`Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01\% of the World's water and approximately 0.8 \% of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100 000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6\% of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the `Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as `receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed `reconciliation ecology'.},

However, the choice of monitoring method becomes highly restricted when following small organisms ({$<$}100~mm), especially in aquatic ecosystems. Stable isotopes are being increasingly used in this respect but rarely at the local spatial scale, i.e. 10--1000~s of metres. We sought to identify movement of small fishes between a main river channel and its tributary. Little overlap in isotope baseline was detected between the two channels despite some temporal variability in {$\delta$}15N of baseline indicator organisms in the main river. The individuals of two small cyprinid fish species (Leuciscus souffia and Alburnoides bipunctatus) of all the size classes (40--100~mm) caught within the tributary showed considerable heterogeneity in {$\delta$}15N values. Classification and discriminant analysis on isotope-derived data distinguished two significantly different groups. Moreover, this result was supported by further sampling of fish caught in the main river (in May and December 2006). Alternative hypotheses, such as dietary differences, biological factors, temporal shifts and spatial differences in diet, did not explain {$\delta$}15N variability. This application of stable isotopes at a relatively small spatial and temporal scales further demonstrates its potential as a tool for ecologists.},

In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes' Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

  abstract = {The metacommunity framework has shed light upon the significance of local and regional processes in shaping ecological communities. However, our knowledge is limited how landscape context (i.e. type and positioning of habitats) influences the structuring of metacommunities. We examined the role of environmental selection (niche-based species sorting), dispersal and drift (i.e. stochastic changes in species abundance) mechanisms on the structuring of fish metacommunities in riverscapes. We used a hierarchical design and examined metacommunity structuring (i) in individual running water habitat types, namely highland streams, lowland streams, highland rivers and lowland rivers; (ii) in landscape types, where patterns in highland and in lowland types were examined separately and (iii) at the level of the whole riverscape, where samples from all running water types were pooled. Elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) analysis, community--environmental relationships in redundancy analysis, and decay of community similarity with distance (distance decay) complemented with partial Mantel tests were used to reveal the mechanisms behind the observed patterns. Both the EMS framework and community--environment relationships revealed the prevalent role of selection (niche-based species sorting mechanisms) on fish metacommunity structuring, although stochastic variability also influenced the results. Metacommunity structures reflecting niche-based mechanisms (Clementsian or quasi-Clementsian) were observed at higher hierarchical levels (i.e. at the riverscape and the landscape type levels), while quasi-Clementsian or random patterns were found within single running water types. Distance decay relationships indicated that dispersal limitation did not clearly affect metacommunity structuring in any combination of running water types. Partial Mantel tests showed that some part of the variation in distance decay could be explained by the correlation between environmental variables and fish assemblage structure in some habitat types, which further suggests the importance of niche-based mechanisms in metacommunity structuring. Our study shows that different metacommunity structures can arise in a hierarchy of habitat types in riverscapes, and niche-based species sorting mechanisms are more influential in their structuring than dispersal ones. Landscape classifications are useful for a better understanding of the structuring of metacommunities in both the freshwater and terrestrial realms.},

Here, we applied elements of metacommunity structure to examine variations in the spatial distributions of stream fishes over time and to explore possible structuring mechanisms. Although the major environmental gradients influencing species distributions remained largely the same in time, the best-fit pattern of metacommunity structure varied according to sampling occasion and whether or not we included non-native species in the analyses. Quasi-Clementsian and Clementsian structures were the predominant best-fit structures, indicating the importance of species turnover among sites and the existence of more or less discrete community boundaries. The environmental gradient most correlated with metacommunity structure was defined by altitude, area of artificial ponds in the catchment, and dissolved oxygen content. Our results suggest that the best-fit metacommunity structure of the native species can change in time in this catchment due to seasonal changes in distribution patterns. However, the distribution of non-native species throughout the landscape homogenizes the temporal variability in metacommunity structure of native species. Further studies are necessary from other regions to examine best-fit metacommunity structures of stream fishes within relatively short environmental gradients.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {In this paper we argue that landscape spatial structure is of central importance in understanding the effects of fragmentation on population survival. Landscape spatial structure is the spatial relationships among habitat patches and the matrix in which they are embedded. Many general models of subdivided populations make the assumptions that (1) all habitat patches are equivalent in size and quality and (2) all local populations (in the patches) are equally accessible by dispersers. Models that gloss over spatial details of landscape structure can be useful for theoretical developments but will almost always be misleading when applied to real-world conservation problems. We show that local extinctions of fragmented populations are common. From this it follows that recolonization of local extinctions is critical for regional survival of fragmented populations. The probability of recolonization depends on (1) spatial relationships among landscape elements used by the population, including habitat patches for breeding and elements of the inter-patch matrix through which dispersers move, (2) dispersal characteristics of the organism of interest, and (3) temporal changes in the landscape structure. For endangered species, which are typically restricted in their dispersal range and in the kinds of habitat through which they can disperse, these factors are of primary importance and must be explicitly considered in management decisions.},

  abstract = {Biologists have long sought to predict the distribution of species across landscapes to understand biodiversity patterns and dynamics. These efforts usually integrate ecological niche and dispersal dynamics, but evolution can also mediate these ecological dynamics. Species that disperse well and arrive early might adapt to local conditions, which creates an evolution-mediated priority effect that alters biodiversity patterns. Yet, dispersal is also a trait that can evolve and affect evolution-mediated priority effects. We developed an individual-based model where populations of competing species can adapt not only to local environments but also to different dispersal probabilities. We found that lower regional species diversity selects for populations with higher dispersal probabilities and stronger evolution-mediated priority effects. When all species evolved dispersal, they monopolized fewer patches and did so at the same rates. When only one of the species evolved dispersal, it evolved lower dispersal than highly dispersive species and monopolized habitats once freed from maladaptive gene flow. Overall, we demonstrate that dispersal evolution can shape evolution-mediated priority effects when provided with a greater ecological opportunity in species-poor communities. Dispersal- and evolution-mediated priority effects probably play greater roles in species-poor regions like the upper latitudes, isolated islands and in changing environments.

  abstract = {Coexistence of species requires equalizing mechanisms that minimize fitness differences, which are balanced by stabilizing mechanisms that enhance negative intraspecific interactions versus interspecific ones. Here, we develop a simple theoretical framework that allows measuring the relative strength of intraspecific versus interspecific competition in dominance hierarchies. We use it to evaluate mechanisms promoting coexistence between two congeneric charr that compete for foraging positions, which strongly influence density-dependent growth and survival. Agonistic interactions (n = 761) among 71 Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma and whitespotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis were measured by snorkelling in two pools in the sympatric zone of a Hokkaido stream during two summers. Interspecific dominance hierarchies, analysed using three methods, were closely correlated with fish length but the species treated each other equally. Ranks for the most dominant fish in each pool, determined directly by knockout experiments, were also virtually identical to ranks by length. Similarly, exponential random graph modelling of the social networks provided no evidence that either species was dominant over the other. Instead, larger fish were more likely to win contests, especially over fish of the next lower ranks. These results demonstrated that the two species were nearly ecological equivalents in accessing key resources in this sympatric zone. Nearly identical growth and stable densities over 4 years further supported this inference, although Dolly Varden were a minority (29\% of the assemblage), a sign of some fitness difference. Detailed foraging observations coupled with two concurrent studies revealed an effective stabilizing mechanism. Dolly Varden shifted to feeding directly from the benthos when drifting invertebrates declined, a behaviour enhanced by morphological character displacement, thereby partitioning food resources and enhancing intraspecific competition while avoiding agonistic encounters with whitespotted charr. The plurality of evidence indicates that fitness differences between these ecologically equivalent species are small in this local assemblage, and balanced by resource partitioning, a modest stabilizing mechanism that promotes coexistence. The theoretical framework presented here is a useful tool to evaluate the strength of interspecific versus intraspecific competition, which combined with information on trade-offs in ecological performance can contribute to a mechanistic understanding of species coexistence.},

  abstract = {The present study investigates the population structure and dynamics of Cottus gobio in three adjoining, hydrologically very different stream sections that are affected by water abstraction (residual flow). During the one-year investigation from October 1997 to September 1998 the selected stretches were repeatedly sampled by electrofishing. Multiple mark-recapture method was applied to determine fish density along the individual stretches and the individual marking technique (VI-tag) was used to record the migratory activity of individual fish. Stretches with intermittent flow (section A) are temporarily colonised by adult Cottus gobio from downstream sites only at higher water levels. These stretches are completely dry for about half of the year and do not enable populations to become established. Small populations persist in those transitional stretches that are intermittently isolated from other surface waters (section B). However, population size is less than one-quarter the size of those in directly adjoining downstream stretches with permanent water flow (section C). In addition, bullheads in section B have considerably poorer conditions. Changes in discharge led to increased migratory activity over the entire study area, whereby the radius of activity of the bullhead was largely (88\%) restricted to distances of {$<$} 150 m. Elevated discharges mostly triggered upstream longitudinal and lateral dispersion. When the water drops to low water level and large areas in these sections dry out, the bullheads have to withdraw into deep pools. This might be the main reason for the lack of the probably less mobile juvenile stages. The results clearly demonstrate that habitat fragmentation resulting from water abstraction has drastic effects on all life stages of Cottus gobioin respect to habitat availability, spatial distribution, movement, fitness and survival. These effects can be seen at an extremely fine scale and are revealed in the significant differences in abundance and condition of Cottus gobiobetween the short (94 m-188 m) adjacent sections. In order to maintain and restore ecological integrity of running waters, the preservation of intact flow conditions is one of the key issues for river management.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Leptokurtic distributions of movement distances observed in field-release studies, in which some individuals move long distances while most remain at or near their release point, are a common feature of mobile animals. However, because leptokurtosis is predicted to be transient in homogeneous populations, persistent leptokurtosis suggests a population heterogeneity. We found evidence for a heterogeneity that may generate persistent leptokurtosis. We tested individuals of the Trinidad killifish Rivulus hartii for boldness in a tank test and released them back into their native stream. Boldness in the tank test predicted distance moved in the field releases, even after effects of size and sex were removed. Further, data from a 19-mo mark-recapture study showed that individual growth correlated positively with movement in a predator-threatened river zone where the Rivulus population is spatially fragmented and dispersal is likely to be a hazardous activity. In contrast, no such correlation existed in a predator-absent zone where the population is unfragmented. These results show that a behavioral trait, not discernible from body size or sex, contributes to dispersal and that a component of fitness of surviving ``dispersers'' is elevated above that of ``stayers,'' a fundamental assumption or prediction of many models of the evolution of dispersal through hazardous habitat.},

I marked fishes with subcutaneous injections of acrylic paints to indicate capture location within a 550-m long study site. Recaptures over an 18-month period primarily occurred within 33 m of the original capture location, suggesting longterm residence in relatively small areas. However, 11 Percina and three Lepomis moved at least 100 m (maximum distance moved = 200 m for Lepomis, 420 m for Percina), and individuals of both species shifted between distinctly different mesohabitats (boulder riffle, sand pool, and gravel riffle). Distance moved did not strongly relate to time between captures. Long-distance movements ({$>$} 33 m) by Percina mostly occurred from Nov. through June. The winter and spring-time movements by darters occurred in upstream and downstream directions and into all three mesohabitats, and at least 40\% of these movements were unassociated with periods of extreme high flow. Periodic long-range movements may allow small fishes to respond to variation in resources over a large area and across a variety of stream habitats.},

We show that both factors consistently increased emigration rates and use metacommunity modelling to highlight consequences on local and regional dynamics. In a coordinated distributed dispersal experiment involving seven laboratories, the authors show that both top-down predation risk and bottom-up resource limitation increase emigration rates across 21 species ranging from protozoa to vertebrates.},

Generally, dispersal decisions are condition-dependent and rely on information in the broad sense, like the presence of conspecifics. However, studies on metacommunities that include interspecific interactions generally disregard condition-dependence. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how dispersal in metacommunities is condition-dependent and whether rules derived from single-species contexts can be scaled up to (meta)communities. Using experimental protist metacommunities, we show how dispersal and movement depend on and are adjusted by the strength of interspecific interactions. We found that the predicting movement and dispersal in metacommunities requires knowledge on behavioural responses to intra- and interspecific interaction strengths. Consequently, metacommunity dynamics inferred directly from single-species metapopulations without taking interspecific interactions into account are likely flawed. Our work identifies the significance of condition-dependence for understanding metacommunity dynamics, stability and the coexistence and distribution of species.},

Here, we show experimentally that the answer depends on the level of community organization considered. In a 9-year grassland experiment, we manipulated initial plant composition on abandoned arable land and subsequently allowed natural colonization. Initial compositional variation caused plant communities to remain divergent in species identities, even though these same communities converged strongly in species traits. This contrast between species divergence and trait convergence could not be explained by dispersal limitation or community neutrality alone. Our results show that the simultaneous operation of trait-based assembly rules and species-level priority effects drives community assembly, making it both deterministic and historically contingent, but at different levels of community organization.},

  abstract = {Eight hundred forty-six reports of tagged fish caught by anglers were analyzed to determine the movement patterns of 14 species of native warm-water stream fishes. Each species included a sedentary group which remained near the release point and a mobile group which ranged more or less freely. The species could be classified according to the relative abundance of the two groups. Rock bass, smallmouth bass, longear sunfish, spotted bass, and yellow bullhead were classified as sedentary species; carp, flathead catfish, largemouth bass, golden redhorse, and black redhorse are semi-mobile; and channel catfish, freshwater drum, and white crappie as mobile. The species varied greatly in the average number of days between tagging and recapture and in the direction of movement and distances traveled by the mobile fish. The mobile group usually was free longer than the sedentary fish but frequently the difference in time was not great. Mobile freshwater drum, golden redhorse, black redhorse, spotted bass, largemouth bass, and longear sunfish tended to travel relatively long distances downstream and much shorter distances upstream. The distances traveled by the remaining species were more nearly equal but the average distance traveled upstream was always the longer. Mobile yellow bullhead, green sunfish, spotted bass, longear sunfish, and largemouth bass seldom traveled more than 25 miles but some mobile carp moved over 200 miles. Other species traveled intermediate distances. When released in headwaters, sedentary species tended to be more sedentary, and semi-mobile species in their preferred habitat also tended to be more sedentary than the average. Mobile spcies and semi-mobile species not in their preferred habitat became more mobile. Most of the mobile fish released in headwaters moved downstream. For the four most numerous species (rock bass, channel catfish, carp, smallmouth bass) data are presented to show the effect of release location, season, and age upon movement. Rock bass were more sedentary in headwaters than farther downstream but channel catfish were more mobile in headwaters. Mobile fish of both species tended to move downstream when released in headwaters but to make more upstream movements when released in down stream areas. Carp seemed to adapt their movements to the physical conditions in the habitat. They were mostly sedentary in stable habitats but predominantly mobile in habitats subject to flooding. The subspecies of the fish, the type of stream, and the geographical location of the release site may have effected the amount and direction of movements of smallmouth bass. All four species showed a relatively high proportion of mobile fish in the spring and low proportions in the summer. Data on fall movements were not conclusive. Rock bass, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass of intermediate age were more mobile than either the younger or the older fish. The concept that the native population of warm-water stream fish species consists of a sedentary and a mobile group provides a logical explanation of many observed phenomena and of contradictory results which have confused some investigators. It supplements recent findings concerning the home ranges of species if it is assumed that only the sedentary group was investigated.},

We sampled quarterly over a 3-year period (1985--1988) at six 800- to 2300-m-long sites in 2 streams near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Overall, distances between successive captures were {$<$} 100 m for approximately two-thirds of all fishes. Only rarely did we document movements over long distances; distances of 17.0-17.6 km between successive captures were obtained for 5 fishes (1 redbreast sunfish, 1 largemouth bass and 3 bluegill), and only one other fish moved {$>$} 10 km. In general, all species were highly sedentary in both streams, with rock bass and redbreast sunfish being the most sedentary and bluegill and largemouth bass being the least. In most instances, redbreast sunfish showed the same distribution of distances between captures regardless of the interval between captures (1 week, 3 months, 6 months or more). This species also tended to be more mobile in the spring and less mobile in the winter, with large fish exibiting the greatest distances between captures. Some redbreast sunfish showed a very restricted home range, being captured 3 or more times over {$\geq$} 6 months in the same 50-m section of stream. A few individuals moved 4-9 km only to return to their original location, but most fish exhibited behaviors intermediate between these extremes. For all species, upstream and downstream movements were equally common, although movements in one direction predominated at some sites for limited periods of time. Knowledge of movement patterns and differences in behavior among species is important not only in understanding the basic ecology of the species but also in designing, conducting and interpreting environmental monitoring studies.},

  abstract = {Movement by stream fish is known to be strongly influenced by abiotic factors such as floods and temperature, but roles of biotic factors, such as predation threat, and interactions of abiotic and biotic factors are less clear. Predation threat is known to fragment populations of killifish, Rivulus hartii, in Trinidad rivers by rendering habitat inhospitable. We asked whether such spatial fragmentation was accompanied by reduced movement by fish in the predator-occupied zone of a river, relative to a zone free of the strong piscivore, Hoplias malabaricus, that causes the fragmentation. We used a 19-mo marking study in a river with a predator barrier, field experiments in the river, and mesocosms to evaluate four hypotheses: (1) the predator reduces prey movement in the river; (2) for the special case of prey leaving refugia, the predator increases movement; (3) movement positively correlates with water level in the predator's presence; and (4) complex physical structure in hazardous habitat promotes prey movement. We marked 1467 Rivulus in the natural study areas and had 1015 recaptures. Contrary to Hypothesis 1 but in support of Hypothesis 2, prey showed greater movement along the river in the presence of the predator, regardless of whether the fish resided in a refuge at its previous capture. An experiment with introduced fish confirmed the findings that movement was elevated in the predator's presence. Effects of an abiotic factor (water level, Hypothesis 3) and a phenotypic trait (body size) depended upon whether the predator was present: movement was independent of water level and body size in the absence of the predator, but positively related to both variables in the predator's presence. Emigration from the river to tributaries was also independent of body size in the predator's absence, but positively size-dependent in the predator's presence. Complex physical structure (Hypothesis 4), in the form of cobble added to experimental pools, enhanced the transit of fish through hazardous pools. This study shows that spatial fragmentation does not necessarily imply that movement between fragments will be impeded (dynamical fragmentation). Rather, it is possible that movement among spatial fragments may be enhanced by the same factor, predation threat, that produced the spatial fragmentation in the first place. Because of the context-dependent effects of an abiotic factor (water level) and a phenotypic variable (body size) on movement, the study also emphasizes the need to clarify the exact role of predation as an agent promoting or retarding movement, and it suggests a need for incorporating such parameters into models of movement and metapopulation dynamics.},

Then, it examines the relationships between metapopulation dynamics, the equilibrium theory of island biogeography, and the dynamics of populations living in patchy environments. It further tackles practical issues and the links between metapopulation dynamics and landscape ecology, and between metapopulation dynamics and conservation biology. Chapters 4 and 5 present structured models describing changes in the number of individuals within patches and an empirical evaluation of local extinction in metapopulation studies. The subsequent chapters discuss several aspects of metapopulation, including dispersal and connectivity, colonization, conspecific attraction, extinction and isolation, and forest fragmentation. The latter chapters describe the concept of habitat fragmentation, the diversity and competition in metapopulations, the community collapse, and the effects of metapopulation studies in predator-prey systems.},

Subcutaneous paint tags were used to associate fish with the pools in which they were initially captured, tagged and released. Few mortalities related to marking techniques were observed in both captive and field-tagged fish. Tag longevity varied among paint colors used and anatomical locations marked. Movements were inferred from recaptured fish collected over a 12-month period. Recaptures within release pools were proportionally greater than movements outside release pools, although the sampling technique used likely overestimated recaptures within release pools. Recaptures outside release pools were more frequent in late spring and early summer, coinciding with the N. lutipinnis spawning season. The linear home range estimate for this species was 42.9 {\textpm} 79.0 m, although this represents a minimum estimate because complex movements by individual fish could not be detected.},

Numerous studies have supported the restricted movement paradigm, but nearly all have relied on the recapture of marked fish from the same areas in which they were released, an approach we believe is biased against detecting movement. We found substantial movement of trout in streams in Colorado and Wyoming using two-way weirs and radio telemetry. A review of the research on Lawrence Creek, Wisconsin, also showed that movement was important in the response of the trout population to habitat enhancement. Movement of resident stream fish has profound implications for research (e.g., measuring production and habitat models) and management (e.g., habitat enhancement, special regulations, and stocking hatchery fish). Methods capable of detecting fish movement could be incorporated into many studies to assess its importance in systems of interest. New theories and experiments are needed to understand the mechanisms that cause stream salmonids to move.},

  abstract = {Diversity and interspecific synchrony are among the main drivers behind the temporal stability of community abundance. Diversity can increase stability through the portfolio effect, while higher synchrony generally decreases stability. In turn, species interactions and similar responses to environmental variation are considered the main factors underlying the strength of interspecific synchrony, despite the challenges in determining their relative roles. The analysis of the relationship between interspecific synchrony and the trait (or phylogenetic) distance between species can increase the robustness of inferences about these factors. Here, we used pairwise interspecific and community-wide analyses to investigate, respectively, the drivers of interspecific synchrony and the influence of trait and phylogenetic diversity on the stability of fish communities. For that, we used 18 years of fish abundance data from the Upper Paran{\'a} River floodplain. At the interspecific level, we used quantile regressions to test within-guild relationships between interspecific synchrony and trait and phylogenetic distance between species. At the community level, we tested the relationships between community-wide synchrony, stability, and (trait and phylogenetic) diversity. We found that interspecific synchrony decreased with trait and phylogenetic distances. In the community-level analysis, we found that more synchronous fish communities were less stable, but the relationship between diversity and stability was in general weak. At the interspecific level, our study highlights the role of similar responses to environmental variation in driving species' temporal dynamics. At the community level, the strength of the relationships between trait or phylogenetic diversity and community stability depended on the feeding guild. On the other hand, we found strong relationships between synchrony and stability. These results suggest that increased synchrony levels in response to regional environmental changes could decrease the stability of fish communities in this floodplain.},

Reproductive enhancement through increased access to mates or resources and the avoidance of inbreeding are important in promoting sex differences in dispersal.

Determining the generality of this relationship, and discovering the mechanisms that underlie it, are vitally important for ecosystem management. Here, we investigate how species richness affects the temporal stability of biomass production by reanalyzing 27 recent biodiversity experiments conducted with primary producers. We find that, in grasslands, increasing species richness stabilizes whole-community biomass but destabilizes the dynamics of constituent populations. Community biomass is stabilized because species richness impacts mean biomass more strongly than its variance. In algal communities, species richness has a minimal effect on community stability because richness affects the mean and variance of biomass nearly equally. Using a new measure of synchrony among species, we find that for both grasslands and algae, temporal correlations in species biomass are lower when species are grown together in polyculture than when grown alone in monoculture. These results suggest that interspecific interactions tend to stabilize community biomass in diverse communities. Contrary to prevailing theory, we found no evidence that species' responses to environmental variation in monoculture predicted the strength of diversity's stabilizing effect. Together, these results deepen our understanding of when and why increasing species richness stabilizes community biomass.},

For fish, dorsal muscle from sacrificed individuals has traditionally been used in stable isotope studies; however, there are many instances when lethal sampling is undesirable. We evaluated the feasibility of using adipose and caudal fin clips as alternatives to muscle in stable isotope studies for five species of salmonids. Because fish size and water temperature can affect stable isotope ratios, we also determined whether fish length and sampling date affected the difference in isotope signatures between fins and muscle. Biopsied muscle plugs and fin clips were collected from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and lake trout S. namaycush as well as lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis and pygmy whitefish Prosopium coulterii and analyzed for stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. The isotope signatures of both adipose and caudal fins were significantly correlated (0.33 {$<$} R2 {$<$} 0.97) with those of dorsal muscle from the five salmonid species studied, and in some cases the signatures of fins did not differ from those of muscle. Fish length and sampling date occasionally had a small effect (0.042 {$<$} R2 {$<$} 0.49) on the relationship between the isotope signatures of fin and muscle. Although muscle biopsy provides a viable, nonlethal method of collecting muscle tissue from suitably sized fish, the strong relationships between the isotope signatures of fin and muscle demonstrate that fin clips should be considered good surrogates for muscle in stable isotope studies of salmonids.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) represent important analytical and predictive tools for ecologists. Until now, these models have either assumed (i) that species' occurrence probabilities are uncorrelated or (ii) that species respond linearly to preselected environmental variables. These two assumptions currently prevent ecologists from modelling assemblages with realistic co-occurrence and species richness properties. This paper introduces a stochastic feedforward neural network, called `mistnet', which makes neither assumption. Thus, unlike most SDMs, mistnet can account for non-independent co-occurrence patterns driven by unobserved environmental heterogeneity. And unlike several recently proposed joint SDMs, the model can also learn nonlinear functions relating species' occurrence probabilities to environmental predictors. Mistnet makes more accurate predictions about the North American bird communities found along Breeding Bird Survey transects than several alternative methods tested. In particular, typical assemblages held out of sample for validation were each tens of thousands of times more likely under the mistnet model than under independent combinations of single-species predictions. Apart from improved accuracy, mistnet shows two other important benefits for ecological research and management. First: by analysing co-occurrence data, mistnet can identify unmeasured -- and perhaps unanticipated -- environmental variables that drive species turnover. For example, the model identified a strong grassland/forest gradient, even though only temperature and precipitation were given as model inputs. Second: mistnet is able to take advantage of outside information to guide its predictions towards more realistic assemblages. For example, mistnet automatically adjusts its expectations to include more forest-associated species in response to a stray observation of a forest-dwelling warbler.},

  abstract = {Background Fish fin is a widely used, non-lethal sample material in studies using stable isotopes to assess the ecology of fishes. However, fish fin is composed of two distinct tissues (ray and membrane) which may have different stable isotope values and are not homogeneously distributed within a fin. As such, estimates of the stable isotope values of a fish may vary according to the section of fin sampled. Methods To assess the magnitude of this variation, we analysed carbon ({$\delta$} 13C), nitrogen ({$\delta$} 15N), hydrogen ({$\delta$} 2H) and oxygen ({$\delta$} 18O) stable isotopes of caudal fin from juvenile, riverine stages of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). Individual fins were sub-sectioned into tip, mid and base, of which a further subset were divided into ray and membrane. Findings Isotope variation between fin sections, evident in all four elements, was primarily related to differences between ray and membrane. Base sections were13C depleted relative to tip ({\textasciitilde} 1 ‰) with equivalent variation evident between ray and membrane. A similar trend was evident in {$\delta$} 2H, though the degree of variation was far greater ({\textasciitilde} 10 ‰). Base and ray sections were 18O enriched ({\textasciitilde} 2 ‰) relative to tip and membrane, respectively. Ray and membrane sections displayed longitudinal variation in 15N mirroring that of composite fin ({\textasciitilde} 1 ‰), indicating that variation in15N values was likely related to ontogenetic variation. Conclusions To account for the effects of intra-fin variability in stable isotope analyses we suggest that researchers sampling fish fin, in increasing priority, 1) also analyse muscle (or liver) tissue from a subsample of fish to calibrate their data, or 2) standardize sampling by selecting tissue only from the extreme tip of a fin, or 3) homogenize fins prior to analysis.},

  abstract = {1. The aim of this paper is to review literature on species diversity patterns of freshwater organisms and underlying mechanisms at large spatial scales. 2. Some freshwater taxa (e.g. dragonflies, fish and frogs) follow the classical latitudinal decline in regional species richness (RSR), supporting the patterns found for major terrestrial and marine organism groups. However, the mechanisms causing this cline in most freshwater taxa are inadequately understood, although research on fish suggests that energy and history are major factors underlying the patterns in total species and endemic species richness. Recent research also suggests that not all freshwater taxa comply with the decline of species richness with latitude (e.g. stoneflies, caddisflies and salamanders), but many taxa show more complex geographical patterns in across-regions analyses. These complexities are even more profound when studies of global, continental and regional extents are compared. For example, clear latitudinal gradients may be present in regional studies but absent in global studies (e.g. macrophytes). 3. Latitudinal gradients are often especially weak in the across-ecosystems analyses, which may be attributed to local factors overriding the effects of large-scale factors on local communities. Nevertheless, local species richness (LSR) is typically linearly related to RSR (suggesting regional effects on local diversity), although saturating relationships have also been found in some occasions (suggesting strong local effects on diversity). Nestedness has often been found to be significant in freshwater studies, yet this pattern is highly variable and generally weak, suggesting also a strong beta diversity component in freshwater systems. 4. Both geographical location and local environmental factors contribute to variation in alpha diversity, nestedness and beta diversity in the freshwater realm, although the relative importance of these two groups of explanatory variables may be contingent on the spatial extent of the study. The mechanisms associated with spatial and environmental control of community structure have also been inferred in a number of studies, and most support has been found for species sorting (possibly because many freshwater studies have species sorting as their starting point), although also dispersal limitation and mass effects may be contributing to the patterns found. 5. The lack of latitudinal gradients in some freshwater taxa begs for further explanations. Such explanations may not be gained for most freshwater taxa in the near future, however, because we lack species-level information, floristic and faunistic knowledge, and standardised surveys along extensive latitudinal gradients. A challenge for macroecology is thus to use the best possible species-level information on well-understood groups (e.g. fish) or use surrogates for species-level patterns (e.g. families) and then develop hypotheses for further testing in the freshwater realm. An additional research challenge concerns understanding patterns and mechanisms associated with the relationships between alpha, beta and gamma components of species diversity. 6. Understanding the mechanistic basis of species diversity patterns should preferably be based on a combination of large-scale macroecological and landscape-scale metacommunity research. Such a research approach will help in elucidating patterns of species diversity across regional and local scales in the freshwater realm.},

  abstract = {Metacommunity ecology addresses the situation where sets of local communities are connected by the dispersal of a number of potentially interacting species. Aquatic systems (e.g. lentic versus lotic versus marine) differ from each other in connectivity and environmental heterogeneity, suggesting that metacommunity organisation also differs between major aquatic systems. Here, we review findings from observational field studies on metacommunity organisation in aquatic systems. Species sorting (i.e. species are `filtered' by environmental factors and occur only at environmentally suitable sites) prevails in aquatic systems, particularly in streams and lakes, but the degree to which dispersal limitation interacts with such environmental control varies among different systems and spatial scales. For example, mainstem rivers and marine coastal systems may be strongly affected by `mass effects' (i.e. where high dispersal rates homogenise communities to some degree at neighbouring localities, irrespective of their abiotic and biotic environmental conditions), whereas isolated lakes and ponds may be structured by dispersal limitation (i.e. some species do not occur at otherwise-suitable localities simply because sites with potential colonists are too far away). Flow directionality in running waters also differs from water movements in other systems, and this difference may also have effects on the role of dispersal in different aquatic systems. Dispersal limitation typically increases with increasing spatial distance between sites, mass effects potentially increase in importance with decreasing distance between sites, and the dispersal ability of organisms may determine the spatial extents at which species sorting and dispersal processes are most important. A better understanding of the relative roles of species sorting, mass effects and dispersal limitation in affecting aquatic metacommunities requires the following: (i) characterising dispersal rates more directly or adopting better proxies than have been used previously; (ii) considering the nature of aquatic networks; (iii) combining correlative and experimental approaches; (iv) exploring temporal aspects of metacommunity organisation and (v) applying past approaches and statistical methods innovatively for increasing our understanding of metacommunity organisation.},

Many metapopulation models show that increasing movement among populations. Many metapopulation models show that increasing movement among populations reduces the chance of metapopulation extinction. However, epidemiological models indicate that increased contact among populations enhances the spread of disease and can trigger epidemics. I have synthesized elements of mathematical epidemiology with metapopulation models. An analytic model showed that highly contagious diseases of moderate severity spread widely, increasing the probability of metapopulation extinction. I also used a simulating model to examine four spatial arrangements of populations: island, necklace, loop, and spider. When infected individuals were allowed to move freely among populations, all of the arrangements exhibited qualitative behavior similar to that exhibited by the analytic models. The most dangerous diseases were those for which infected populations grew large enough to produce dispersers that infected other populations, but which also reduced the geometric rate of increase for infected populations to near unity. Under those conditions, random demographic and environmental events caused metapopulation extinction. Major differences among the spatial arrangements emerged when a quarantine population was established. A centralized quarantine in the spider and necklace arrangement yielded the most dramatic reductions in metapopulation extinction probability. A single quarantine patch was of little value in an island arrangement. These results have several implications for managing metapopulations. Most notably, some spatial arrangements of populations are more amenable to disease control than others, and establishing a quarantine population can increase the probability of detecting new diseases and reduce the impact of diseases that do appear.},

  abstract = {There is evidence that actively moving salmonids are of lower condition than the general population, and they are sometimes regarded as inferior to resident fish. However, little information exists on the permanence of this attribute. We used mark--recapture and two-way traps to determine whether there are differences in the condition and growth of mobile and resident Bonneville cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki utah in Beaver Creek, Idaho. Actively moving fish were significantly larger than the general population, and the largest of these mobile fish were in significantly lower condition for a given size. However, mobile fish that were marked and recaptured a year later had regained condition equivalent to that of the general population upon their recapture, and the largest mobile fish had significantly greater condition than fish of equal length in the general population. In contrast, there was no relationship between growth rate and the total distance moved during the 1-year period. These results suggest that the lower condition of actively moving fish does not have permanent effects on future condition or growth in stream-resident cutthroat trout.}

  abstract = {Body size is a fundamental trait known to allometrically scale with metabolic rate and therefore a key determinant of individual development, life history, and consequently fitness. In spatially structured environments, movement is an equally important driver of fitness. Because movement is tightly coupled with body size, we expect habitat fragmentation to induce a strong selection pressure on size variation across and within species. Changes in body size distributions are then, in turn, expected to alter food web dynamics. However, no consensus has been reached on how spatial isolation and resource growth affect consumer body size distributions. Our aim was to investigate how these two factors shape the body size distribution of consumers under scenarios of size-dependent and size-independent consumer movement by applying a mechanistic, individual-based resource--consumer model. We also assessed the consequences of altered body size distributions for important ecosystem traits such as resource abundance and consumer stability. Finally, we determined those factors that explain most variation in size distributions. We demonstrate that decreasing connectivity and resource growth select for communities (or populations) consisting of larger species (or individuals) due to strong selection for the ability to move over longer distances if the movement is size-dependent. When including size-dependent movement, intermediate levels of connectivity result in increases in local size diversity. Due to this elevated functional diversity, resource uptake is maximized at the metapopulation or metacommunity level. At these intermediate levels of connectivity, size-dependent movement explains most of the observed variation in size distributions. Interestingly, local and spatial stability of consumer biomass is lowest when isolation and resource growth are high. Finally, we highlight that size-dependent movement is of vital importance for the survival of populations or communities within highly fragmented landscapes. Our results demonstrate that considering size-dependent movement is essential to understand how habitat fragmentation and resource growth shape body size distributions---and the resulting metapopulation or metacommunity dynamics---of consumers.},

  abstract = {Movement is important to all organisms, and accordingly it is addressed in a huge number of papers in the literature. Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34\% focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement.},

  abstract = {Community ecology increasingly seeks to integrate the influences of regional and historical processes with species interactions within local habitats. This broadened perspective is largely based on comparative approaches that employ ``natural experiments'' to identify factors shaping community structure. Because coastal rivers are separated from one another by insurmountable barriers (oceans or land), freshwater fishes are particularly well suited for comparative analyses of factors that influence fish community organization. In this chapter, we review how this comparative approach shed light on large-scale biodiversity gradients, community saturation, community convergence, density compensation, and the role of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in community dynamics. The main factors (e.g., river mouth discharge and history) empirically related to species richness of a river are well identified, and metacommunity ecology provides a fruitful conceptual framework for understanding how regional (river) species richness translates into local species richness. Much work remains to identify factors explaining differences among whole river basin assemblages with regard to ecological traits (e.g., trophic status and life history) composition and to assess whether trait-related environmental and biotic local filters act similarly over large spatial scales. One important conclusion that can be drawn from the studies reviewed here is that history cannot be neglected whatever the scale of investigation (global, river, or site). A second conclusion is that historical effects are not strong enough to blur the occurrence of qualitatively repeatable patterns of community structure over large spatial scale, which is encouraging because it suggests development of general predictive models of community structure is an attainable goal.},

Although these developments have provided ecologists with new perspectives, their full impact has been hampered by an inability to statistically compare individual communities using descriptive metrics. 2. We solve these issues by reformulating the metrics in a Bayesian framework. This reformulation takes account of uncertainty in the sampled data and naturally incorporates error arising from the sampling process, propagating it through to the derived metrics. 3. Furthermore, we develop novel multivariate ellipse-based metrics as an alternative to the currently employed Convex Hull methods when applied to single community members. We show that unlike Convex Hulls, the ellipses are unbiased with respect to sample size, and their estimation via Bayesian inference allows robust comparison to be made among data sets comprising different sample sizes. 4. These new metrics, which we call SIBER (Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R), open up more avenues for direct comparison of isotopic niches across communities. The computational code to calculate the new metrics is implemented in the free-to-download package Stable Isotope Analysis for the R statistical environment.},

  abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of phenotypes among populations is of major importance for species evolution and ecosystem functioning. Dispersal has long been assumed to homogenise populations in structured landscapes by generating maladapted gene flows, making spatial heterogeneity of phenotypes traditionally considered resulting from local adaptation or plasticity. However, there is accumulating evidence that individuals, instead of dispersing randomly in the landscapes, adjust their dispersal decisions according to their phenotype and the environmental conditions. Specifically, individuals might move in the landscape to find and settle in the environmental conditions that best match their phenotype, therefore maximizing their fitness, a hypothesis named habitat matching. Although habitat matching and associated non-random gene flows can produce spatial phenotypic heterogeneity, their potential consequences for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning are still poorly understood. Here, we discuss evidence for intra and interspecific drivers of habitat matching, and highlight the potential consequences of this process for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning. We conclude that habitat matching might deeply affect the eco-evolutionary dynamics of meta-systems, pointing out the need for further empirical and theoretical research on its incidence and implications for species and communities evolution under environmental changes.},

We highlight the potential benefits of resampling individually tagged stream fish as compared to standard approaches. Specifically we focus on growth, survival, movements and population estimation. The advantages of estimating sizes and growth rates from individual size trajectories include obtaining growth histories and the ability to perform retrospective analysis of the consequences of different life-history strategies. An example might be the patterns of growth leading to either early maturity or migration. Resampling known individuals is the only way we know to chart both short-term and long-term movements and to assign growth and mortality consequences to such movements. Finally, individual-level data permit robust estimation of survival and density/abundance using methods such as Cormack/Jolly-Seber. The results indicate that population estimates were about 10\% lower using individual data than using population data, that survival from sample to sample was typically {$>$}90\%, that the majority of recaptured fish did not move during the summer, that growth was rapid during spring and most fish lost mass during the summer and that growth trajectories for maturing and non-maturing fish showed substantially different patterns. An individual-based approach to stream fish ecology provides the opportunity to explore the mechanisms responsible for population-level patterns but comes at the cost of significant field effort. Tradeoffs between increased data resolution and the effort required to obtain the data must be considered before undertaking individual-based field studies of stream fishes.NOTE},

  abstract = {Mangrove plants, which develop highly productive forests on tropical--subtropical coastlines and river estuaries, rely mainly on river and sea water currents for their diaspore dispersal. Mangrove diaspores are basically dispersed in brackish to sea waters; thus whether they sink or float during the dispersal period could be changed dynamically, both spatially and temporally, depending on the salinity to which they are exposed, as well as on their specific gravity (SG). We found that the SG of diaspores of two mangrove species, Rhizophora stylosa and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, which are dominant species and form a typical zonation (B. gymnorrhiza in inland areas and R. stylosa in more seaward areas) in the study area, changed spatially and temporally. Bruguiera gymnorrhiza gradually lost its SG in accordance with elapsed time, while R. stylosa lost its SG in the first 6 h and gained gradually according to elapsed time. Hydrodynamic simulation of dispersal patterns, in combination with observed specific gravity changes of both diaspores and river water, demonstrated that the spatio-temporal pattern of specific gravity change was closely related to the difference in dispersal behaviors between the species. The diaspore of B. gymnorrhiza generally disperses upstream, and covers wider ranges than that of R. stylosa, at least in the early phase of dispersal. These dispersal behaviors agreed well with the distribution pattern of the species across estuaries in the study site. To date, hydrochory has been considered to be a mostly passive process governed by the dynamics of water current and subsequent sediment movement, with fixed diaspore characteristics such as shape and buoyancy.

  abstract = {Movements of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki), and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were studied by observations and recapture of marked individuals in three western Washington streams to test the hypotheses that few fish would move, downstream movement would predominate, movers would be initially smaller and grow slower after movement than residents, and habitat quality would influence movement. Contrary to predictions, from 28 to 60\% of marked fish moved at least one habitat unit, and immigration of unmarked fish also indicated considerable movement. Upstream movement predominated but the stream with the step-pool/cascade channel type had fewer upstream movers and greater distances moved downstream. Coho movers were not smaller than nonmovers, as predicted based on assumptions that movement results from competitive exclusion. Habitat units that coho left were smaller and shallower but lower in density than units where coho remained. Thus, movement is a common phenomenon rather than an aberration, and may reflect habitat choice rather than territorial eviction. Moreover, movers grew faster than nonmovers, so the "mobile fraction" of the population was not composed of competitively inferior fish but rather individuals that thrived. The phenomenon of small-scale habitat- and growth-related movements should be considered when planning and interpreting studies of juvenile salmonid ecology in streams.},

  abstract = {Objective Hatcheries are used to help supplement populations of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. for conservation and fisheries purposes and to provide stewardship opportunities. In British Columbia, small community-run hatcheries typically focus on the latter and generally do not know the efficacy of their release approaches, unlike larger production hatcheries. Methods We used acoustic telemetry to track the survival and behavior of 90 hatchery-reared Coho Salmon O. kisutch smolts, released from a community hatchery, through Burrard Inlet and into the Strait of Georgia. This is the first study to track Coho Salmon smolts released directly into a marine environment and one of very few studies to track them in an oceanic setting. Result Smolt survival was lowest through the first 3 km of the migration at 37\%, and the estimated cumulative survival to the final array ( 20 km from release) was 10--23\%. The presence of numerous predators in the region suggests that predation is a possible explanation for poor survival over the relatively short migration distance. Travel rates ranged from 4 to 18 km/day, depending on the migration segment, which is slower than the marine migration of smolts from other species, likely increasing exposure to predators. However, we found potential evidence of ``predator swamping,'' as survival estimates across migration segments were highest for the final of our three release groups and poorest for the first release group, with intergroup survival estimates increasing by 7--12\% in the final three migration segments. Releasing smolts at high densities and at night, as our partner hatchery currently does, likely improves smolt survival. Conclusion Our work demonstrates how acoustic telemetry can be used to examine hatchery practices and propose potential improvements. Saltwater readiness and the release location are factors that our results suggest may warrant future attention to potentially improve marine survival of Coho Salmon smolts.},

In this paper, we conducted a three-day laboratory study to evaluate whether metrics of body condition affected movement of wild-caught creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) at 16 and 22{$^\circ$}C. Movement was counted between two circular tanks connected by a straight corridor, which was equipped with a pair of passive integrated transponder antennas. Fish movement was most frequent during periods of darkness in a simulated photoperiod, and more mobile individuals consistently moved more frequently across the 3 days. In general, individuals in better body condition were more mobile than those in poorer condition, and different metrics of body condition affected movement to different degrees. Specifically, per cent weight loss and dry matter content (ratio of wet versus dehydrated weight) were better predictors of movement than weight-at-length, which is most typically used as a surrogate of body condition in animals. In addition, body condition and length interacted to affect fish movement, where body condition affected movement of smaller individuals more significantly than that of larger individuals. Body condition effects on activity were similar at 16 and 22{$^\circ$}C. This study demonstrates that body condition metrics may not always affect certain behavior in a similar way. Body condition metrics need to be carefully selected when used in the context of animal behavior, and more than a single metric should be tested when feasible.},

Based on physical mark--recapture of 501 unique individuals and detection by mobile PIT antenna over monthly intervals, a majority of fish (70\%--80\%) stayed within 60 m of previously released locations, demonstrating what appeared to be restricted movement patterns. However, fixed PIT antenna data showed that as much as 17\% of marked individuals emigrated from the study area during the 2-month study period. Probability of emigration did not depend on where in the 1-km segment individuals had been released, indicating that emigration likely represented long-distance movement. Once emigrants made a decision to emigrate, they left the tributary within 1--3 median days by moving downstream in a unidirectional manner, based on detections at a total of three antenna arrays deployed throughout the tributary. Our multiscale analysis provided strong support for co-existence of short- and long-distance movement patterns, and we conclude that movement data at multiple spatial scales complement each other to characterize population-scale movement.

  abstract = {Population dynamics and species interactions are spread out in space. This might seem like a trivial observation, but it has potentially important consequences. In particular, mathematical models show that the dynamics of populations can be altered fundamentally simply because organisms interact and disperse rather than being confined to one position for their entire lives. Models that deal with dispersal and spatially distributed populations are extraordinarily varied, partly because they employ three distinct characterizations of space: as 'islands' (or `metapopulations'), as `stepping-stones', or as a continuum. Moreover, there are several different ways of representing dispersal in spatially structured environments, as well as several possibilities for allowing environmental variation to come into play. In spite of this variety, a few common themes emerge from spatial models. First, island and stepping-stone models emphasize that little can be concluded from simply recording patterns of' occupancy, instead a metapopulation's fate will be determined by the balance between local extinction and recolonization and how that balance interacts with random catastrophes. Island and stepping-stone models also make it clear that the spatial dimension, in particular spatial subdivision, can alter the stability of species interactions and opportunities for coexistence in both predator---prey and competitive systems. Continuum models, which usually take the form of reaction-diffusion equations, address slightly different questions. Reaction-diffusion theory suggests that in uniform environments, certain combinations of local dynamics and dispersal can produce persistent irregularities in the dispersion of species. These striking spatial patterns, which are called diffusive instabilities, can arise from predator---prey interactions, Lotka-Volterra competitive interactions, and from density-dependent population growth in an age-structured population. Moreover, although they differ fundamentally in their structure, the three major classes of spatial models share the common generalization that spatial effects should be expected only for: (i) selected spatial scales; (ii) specific dispersal rates, and (iii) particular patterns of environmental variation relative to the frequency and range of dispersal. The theoretical possibilities are thus contingent on spatial scale and dispersal rates. Although explicit experimental tests of spatial models are non-existent, a handful of studies report general changes in species interactions associated with manipulations of habitat subdivision. Observational studies with adequate data concerning dispersal and scale are also scarce; but those few observational studies with the appropriate supporting information consistently show profound spatial effects, especially effects due to habitat subdivision. The challenge for empiricists is to investigate more rigorously the roles of spatial subdivision and dispersal in natural communities. The challenge for theoreticians is to make the empiricist's job easier; this can best be done by delineating when spatial effects are most likely to be influential, and by offering guidance on how to design appropriate experiments. Simply saying that the spatial environment is important is to mouth a platitude: what we need to know is whether this presumed importance amounts to much in natural systems.}

While equally all food sources contributed to the biomass of all fish species in the summer, their biomass is supported by more specialized sources in the winter season. Our results revealed increased niche breadth with increased niche overlap between C. antalyensis and C. gibelio, and C. carpio, and among C. gibelio and C. carpio in the summer, while decreased niche breadth with decreased niche overlap in the winter season. Interspecific competition has led to trophic niche divergence, which may facilitate the coexistence of native species with introduced fishes.

To address this issue, we developed a model framework in which species with distinct quantitative dispersal traits that govern the three stages of dispersal---departure, movement and settlement---compete under different ecological contexts. The model identified three primary dispersal strategies (referred to as nomadic, homebody and habitat-sorting) that consistently dominated metacommunities owing to the interplay of spatiotemporal environmental variation and different types of competitive interactions. We outlined the key characteristics of each strategy and formulated theoretical predictions regarding the abiotic and biotic conditions under which each strategy is more likely to prevail in metacommunities. By presenting our results as relationships between dispersal traits and well-known ecological gradients (e.g. seasonality), we were able to contrast our theoretical findings with previous empirical research. Our model demonstrates how landscape environmental characteristics and competitive interactions at the intra- and interspecific levels can interact to favour distinct multivariate and context-dependent dispersal strategies in metacommunities.

Although effects of positive interactions have often been observed at local scales, much less is known about consequences at larger spatial scales. Here, we study nest associations of stream fishes -- widespread reproductive facilitation between host (nest-builder) and beneficiary (nest associate) species in North America -- as a model system to examine the role of positive interactions in determining the metapopulation-level relationship between host and beneficiary species. Using regional data of fish distribution in the Midwestern US, we found that watershed-level occupancy of host species (i.e. metapopulation occupancy) remarkably increased that of nest associates. Our results illustrated that the effects of positive biotic interactions at the metapopulation level were comparable or even stronger than environmental drivers, i.e. factors that have been studied most extensively in metapopulation studies. Further, our model supported the hypothesis that the metapopulation-level relationship between hosts and nest associates was mediated by a gradient of environmental conditions: strong associations occurred under stressful habitats. This study provides insightful evidence that positive biotic interactions have larger scale consequences for distributions of organisms than previously thought. Successful biodiversity conservation may need a broader framework that appreciates the role of positive biotic interactions at larger spatial scales.},

Fish were tagged and released in autumn 2007--2009 in the mid-Murray (n = 42) and lower Goulburn (n = 37) rivers within 3--6 km of the mid-Murray-lower Goulburn junction. 38\% of tagged fish undertook mainstem--tributary movements, characterised mostly by temporary occupation followed by return of fish to the original capture river. Approximately 10\% of tagged fish exhibited longer-term shifts between the mainstem and tributary. Movement of fish from the tributary into the mainstem occurred primarily during the spawning season and in some years coincided with the presence of golden perch eggs/larvae in drift samples in the mainstem. Many of the tributary-to-mainstem movements occurred during or soon after changes in flow. The movements of fish from the mainstem into the tributary were irregular and did not appear to be associated with spawning. The findings show that golden perch moved freely across the mainstem--tributary interface. This demonstrates the need to consider the spatial, behavioural and demographic interdependencies of aquatic fauna across geographic management units such as rivers.},

Our results suggest that larger fish are subject to lower predation risks and are less affected by food deprivation than small fish, with fish decreasing their responses to food--deprivation treatments more strongly with increasing body length than to predation treatments. This may explain our observation that large fish emerged later from a refuge than small ones and spent shorter times outside the refuge. The key role of differential responses to food deprivation was further illustrated by the finding that the relative weight loss of individual fish was strongly correlated with a reduction in hiding time even in the absence of body length differences.

Exploitation rates and movement rates for Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) are estimated by fitting a spatially structured model to three types of data obtained from pop-up satellite, archival, and conventional tags for the period 1990--2006 in the western North Atlantic. A sequential Bayesian statistical approach is applied in which the key components of the model are separated and fitted sequentially to data sets pertinent to each component with the posterior probability density function (pdf) of parameters from one analysis serving as the prior pdf for the next. The approach sequentially updates the estimates of age-specific fishing mortality rates (F) and transoceanic movement rates (T). Estimates of recent F are higher than the estimated rate of natural mortality and higher in the east than in the west. Estimates of annual T from the west to the east are higher for larger fish (6\% for ages 0--3 to 16\% for ages 9+). These estimates are also higher than those obtained from tagging studies before the 1990s and could be associated with changes in stock composition.},

However, progress in this important area of ecology has been hindered by differing viewpoints on CDD across subfields in ecology, lack of synthesis across CDD-related frameworks, and misunderstandings about how empirical measurements of local CDD fit within the context of broader ecological theories on community assembly and diversity maintenance. Here, we propose a conceptual synthesis of local-scale CDD and its causes, including species-specific antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. First, we compare and clarify different uses of CDD and related concepts across subfields within ecology. We suggest the use of local stabilizing/destabilizing CDD to refer to the scenario where local conspecific density effects are more negative/positive than heterospecific effects. Second, we discuss different mechanisms for local stabilizing and destabilizing CDD, how those mechanisms are interrelated, and how they cut across several fields of study within ecology. Third, we place local stabilizing/destabilizing CDD within the context of broader ecological theories and discuss implications and challenges related to scaling up the effects of local CDD on populations, communities, and metacommunities. The ultimate goal of this synthesis is to provide a conceptual roadmap for researchers studying local CDD and its implications for population and community dynamics.},

  abstract = {Conceptually, trophic niche overlap and species abundance can describe the strength and number of interspecific trophic interactions to determine the competitive impact on reintroduced species or other ecosystem changes. We use an example with young-of-year (YOY) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reintroductions to determine whether trophic niche overlaps and abundances limit restoration success. Using seasonal stable isotopes and abundance estimates for invertivorous fishes in three Lake Ontario tributaries, we assessed community isotopic structure, trophic niche overlap, and the impact of the niche overlap by incorporating relative abundance. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) YOY could be a strong competitor with a high trophic niche overlap with Atlantic salmon YOY, but at lower abundances relative to Atlantic salmon there is minimal impact. Stream resident fish communities appeared to partition resources across seasons such that abundant species had low trophic niche overlap to minimize overall competition with Atlantic salmon YOY given available resources, indicating niche complementarity. Through joint consideration of trophic overlap and abundance using our conceptual model, the competitive impact of community composition on a reintroduced species could be assessed.},

  abstract = {Decisions to disperse from a habitat stand out among organismal behaviours as pivotal drivers of ecosystem dynamics across scales. Encounters with other species are an important component of adaptive decision-making in dispersal, resulting in widespread behaviours like tracking resources or avoiding consumers in space. Despite this, metacommunity models often treat dispersal as a function of intraspecific density alone. We show, focusing initially on three-species network motifs, that interspecific dispersal rules generally drive a transition in metacommunities from homogeneous steady states to self-organized heterogeneous spatial patterns. However, when ecologically realistic constraints reflecting adaptive behaviours are imposed---prey tracking and predator avoidance---a pronounced homogenizing effect emerges where spatial pattern formation is suppressed. We demonstrate this effect for each motif by computing master stability functions that separate the contributions of local and spatial interactions to pattern formation. We extend this result to species-rich food webs using a random matrix approach, where we find that eventually, webs become large enough to override the homogenizing effect of adaptive dispersal behaviours, leading once again to predominately pattern-forming dynamics. Our results emphasize the critical role of interspecific dispersal rules in shaping spatial patterns across landscapes, highlighting the need to incorporate adaptive behavioural constraints in efforts to link local species interactions and metacommunity structure.

We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

Green sunfish occurred in most first-order tributaries; when they were present, their abundance and biomass almost always exceeded that of any other coexisting species. Green sunfish also occurred in all second- and third-order streams surveyed, but they never dominated the fish community by numbers or weight in those situations. When green sunfish were removed from three first-order streams, most native species increased in numbers and biomass; in two streams the increase more than made up (within 2 years) the biomass that had been lost by removing green sunfish. These removal experiments indicate that green sunfish suppress native fish populations in Piedmont headwaters. Predation on the young of other species is one likely means by which they do this.

Synergies through national and global acoustic tracking networks are facilitating significant discoveries and unexpected observations that yield novel insight into the movement ecology and habitat use of wild animals. Here, we present a selection of case studies that highlight unexpected tracking observations or absence of observations where we expected to find animals in aquatic systems around the globe. These examples span freshwater and marine systems across spatiotemporal scales ranging from adjacent watersheds to distant ocean regions. These unexpected movements showcase the power of collaborative telemetry networks and serendipitous observations. Unique and unexpected observations such as those presented here can capture the imagination of both researchers and members of the public, and improve understanding of movement and connectivity within aquatic ecosystems.},

Changes in fish community variables proposed for the IBI were tested in seven similar streams exhibiting a wide range of stream degradation due to sewage, mining, and urbanization. A consistent response with increasing stream degradation was found for the following variables: Total number of species, proportion of individuals as creek chubs Semotilus atromaculatus, species richness and composition of darters (Percidae), number of fish in sample, and proportion of fish with disease or anomalies. Proportions of omnivores, insectivorous cyprinids, and herbivore-detritivores yielded inconsistent results due to confounding interactions with species tolerance, whereas alternative trophic metrics, the proportions of specialist insectivores and generalist feeders, produced consistent trends with increasing stream degradation. A modified IBI, based on six fish community attributes, exhibited close agreement with independent rankings of stream degradation.},

These streams are of particular interest since they support populations of spotted bass and other game fishes. The present work considers the fish population of the headwaters of one of these stream systems, the Clear Creek drainage. This system includes about 15 miles of stream, made up of Clear Creek proper and its major tributary, Hutchins' Creek. With the exception of periods of excessive rainfall, the headwaters of the streams are in the form of pools 100 to 200 feet long separated by riffles and shallows 50 to 1,000 feet in length and ranging in width from 6 to 20 feet. Pool depths range up to 5 feet. The pools were sampled by means of an electrofishing device at selected sampling stations located at intervals of about 1 mile or less. A sample consisted of the majority of the fish from a large pool along with those of the adjoining riffles. Analysis of the populations included consideration of species composition, size composition, and determination of rate of growth and coefficient of condition where possible. Twenty-three species of fish were taken from the headwaters of the two streams. The principal species included: longear sunfish, Lepomis megalotis (Rafinesque); green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus (Rafinesque); spotted bass, Micropterus punctulatus (Rafinesque); stoneroller, Campostoma anomalum (Rafinesque); bluntnose minnow, Hyborhynchus notatus (Rafinesque); creek chub, Semotilus atromaculatus (Mitchill); golden redhorse, Moxostoma erythrurum (Rafinesque); white sucker, Catostomus commersoni (Lac{\'e}p{\`e}de); rainbow darter, Poecilichthys caeruleus (Storer); and madtom, Schilbeodes insignis (Richardson). The stoneroller was by far the most abundant fish. The longear and green sunfish were common enough to furnish some fishing. The spotted bass was very scarce although it is known to be present in larger numbers in these waters in the spring. The population of green and longear sunfish included a surprisingly large number of larger fish. It was concluded that heavy predation on younger fishes probably accounted for this unusual size distribution.},

Total variation among the deep-water assemblages (11 species, 86\% turnover across gill net samples) was greater than for shallow-margins (38 species, 64\% turnover across seine samples). For both shallow-margin and deep-water assemblages, variation was greater among sites than between winter and summer seasons. Shallow-margin assemblage structure was related to depth, velocity and substrate, whereas for deep-water assemblages river discharge, temperature and velocity were important. Season itself accounted for little of the variation among either shallow (6.7\%) or deep-water (2.3\%) assemblages. Overall temporal patterns of shallow-margin samples appeared to show responses to juvenile recruitment, spates and migration of coastal fishes, whereas for deep-water samples, patterns related to use of reproductive habitats, juvenile recruitment and seasonal activity levels. Brazos River assemblages were less variable overall in comparison with studies along similar length of reach in headwater streams and wadeable rivers. The residual variation in species distribution (54\% for shallow-margin and 67\% for deepwater) that was not explained by instream variables and season suggests a greater influence of biotic interactions in rivers, particularly those across the spatially dynamic interface of main channel habitats and shallow river margins.},

  abstract = {Many ecosystems develop strikingly regular spatial patterns because of small-scale interactions between organisms, a process generally referred to as spatial self-organization. Self-organized spatial patterns are important determinants of the functioning of ecosystems, promoting the growth and survival of the involved organisms, and affecting the capacity of the organisms to cope with changing environmental conditions. The predominant explanation for self-organized pattern formation is spatial heterogeneity in establishment, growth and mortality, resulting from the self-organization processes. A number of recent studies, however, have revealed that movement of organisms can be an important driving process creating extensive spatial patterning in many ecosystems. Here, we review studies that detail movement-based pattern formation in contrasting ecological settings. Our review highlights that a common principle, where movement of organisms is density-dependent, explains observed spatial regular patterns in all of these studies. This principle, well known to physics as the Cahn--Hilliard principle of phase separation, has so-far remained unrecognized as a general mechanism for self-organized complexity in ecology. Using the examples presented in this paper, we explain how this movement principle can be discerned in ecological settings, and clarify how to test this mechanism experimentally. Our study highlights that animal movement, both in isolation and in unison with other processes, is an important mechanism for regular pattern formation in ecosystems.},

Classic ecological theory1,2 posits that niches dictate the maximum number of species that can coexist in a community and that the richness of observed species will be below this maximum only where immigration is very low. A new alternative theory3,4 is that niches, instead, dictate the minimum number of coexisting species and that the richness of observed species will usually be well above this because of ongoing immigration. We conducted an experimental test to discriminate between these two unified theories using a manipulative field experiment with tropical intertidal communities. We found, consistent with the new theory, that the relationship of species richness to immigration rate stabilized at a low value at low immigration rates and did not saturate at high immigration rates. Our results suggest that tropical intertidal communities have low niche diversity and are typically in a dispersal-assembled regime where immigration is high enough to overfill the niches. Observational data from other studies3,5 suggest that these conclusions may generalize to other ecological systems. Our new experimental approach can be adapted for other systems and be used as a `niche detector' and a tool for assessing when communities are niche versus dispersal assembled.},

  abstract = {Dispersal can strongly influence local population dynamics and may be critical to species persistence in fragmented landscapes. Theory predicts that dispersal by resident stream organisms is necessary to offset the loss of individuals to downstream drift. However, there is a lack of empirical data linking dispersal and drift to local population dynamics in streams, leading to uncertainty regarding the general demographic significance of these processes and the power of drift to explain observed dispersal patterns. I assessed the contribution of dispersal along a first-order stream to population dynamics of the headwater salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (Plethodontidae). I conducted mark--recapture surveys of two contiguous 500 m long sections of a study stream in June, July, and August of 1999, 2000, and 2001. Movement by G. porphyriticus larvae and adults showed a strong upstream bias in the study stream, as well as in 11 other streams that I surveyed. Using mark--recapture models and Akaike's information criterion for model selection, monthly probability of dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section of the study stream (mean {\textpm} 1 se) was estimated to be 0.02 {\textpm} 0.01. The probability of dispersal from the upstream section to the downstream section was 0.00 {\textpm} 0.00. Monthly survival probabilities did not differ between sections. Estimated monthly population growth rates were 1.01 {\textpm} 0.01 in both sections. Net dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section contributed to the equality of population growth rates. Additionally, reproduction and individual condition were lower in the upstream section, suggesting that population stability and growth there (i.e., {$\lambda$} {$\geq$} 1.0) may have been dependent on immigration from downstream. Similar interactions between dispersal and variation in local demographic rates along the stream continuum may underlie the distribution and abundance patterns of other organisms at multiple spatial scales. Greater empirical understanding of these interactions will improve conservation of stream biota. The strong upstream bias of G. porphyriticus movement suggests that dispersal is not a response to downstream drift. I propose an alternative model for the evolution of directionally biased dispersal based on the landscape-scale distribution of headwater habitats.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated the widespread existence of spatio-temporal variations in the abundance and distribution of species of freshwater fishes, previously assumed not to move between habitats. These movements are often on a seasonal or ontogenetic basis, for spawning, feeding and refuge, and in many cases are fundamental for the successful completion of lifecycles. This important book provides a single source for a range of previously widely dispersed information on these movements of fish in fresh waters, covering potamodromous fishes as well as the more familiar diadromous species, worldwide. Contents include full descriptions of types of migration and spatial behaviour, the stimulus and capacity for fish to migrate, the effects of climate on patterns of migratory behaviour, a taxonomic analysis (mostly by family) of freshwater fish migration, methods for studying migration, and details of the impacts of man's activities on freshwater fish migration. Migration of Freshwater Fishes provides an excellent and comprehensive reference to which the river manager, biologist or student can now refer to obtain information, advice and current opinion on the migratory behaviour of most taxonomic groups of fishes occurring in fresh water. University libraries and aquatic research stations should also have copies of this essential reference book on their shelves.  Well-known international authors. Of great commercial importance to fisheries and professional angling bodies. Draws together much new information in one place. Detailed review of world wide migratory behaviour for most groups of freshwater fishes. Pure and applied relevance, for academics, fisheries scientists, river managers and conservationists.

To provide information on the movements and localized activity of barbel Barbus barbus (Cyprinidae) in a river containing potentially obstructing weirs, 31 adult barbel were radio-tracked in the River Nidd, a tributary of the Yorkshire Ouse, North East England between June 1993 and September 1994. 2. Barbel exhibited substantial movements, ranging from 2 to nearly 20 km. Four fish are known to have moved between the Nidd and the Ouse, demonstrating that at least a part of the barbel population utilize the Nidd and Ouse at different times of the year. 3. Range of upstream movement was restricted by the presence and nature of several weirs, including Skip Bridge flow-gauging weir. Low levels of spawning downstream of Skip Bridge weir appear to have been due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat. 4. Movements followed a seasonal pattern, with males and females migrating upstream in spring to spawn on gravel beds. Females moved downstream more quickly than males over the summer months. Both sexes moved downstream in autumn and winter. Day length and water temperature were the best predictors in relation to distance moved up the River Nidd. Descriptive models, relating movement to water temperature and day length, are provided. 5. For both sexes, localized activity varied greatly on both diel and seasonal scales, and was mainly associated with foraging. During summer there was typically a bimodal pattern of diel activity with peaks usually in early morning and late evening. In winter, mean daily activity was less than 20\% of peak summer levels and fish were relatively dormant. In winter, diel activity patterns exhibited a single peak towards dusk. Mean daily activity levels for each month were linearly correlated with mean monthly water temperatures, even during the months where movement to and on the spawning sites occurred. 6. The importance of natural migrations and seasonal activity patterns for barbel, and likewise many other riverine cyprinids, has probably been underestimated for a wide variety of river systems. As major components of riverine fish communities, the importance of seasonal movements of mobile cyprinid species should be considered when constructing weirs and other obstructions. Greater consideration should be given to ways of mitigating effects of existing barriers to movement of non-salmonid species.},

  abstract = {1. This study analysed changes occurring in Mediterranean stream fish assemblages over a sequence of dry years followed by a generally wet period (1991--98). Variations in assemblage attributes were quantified at the basin and stream reach scales, and related to variables reflecting the occurrence of unusually dry or wet conditions. 2. Assemblage variability increased along with the resolution of analysis, with little changes in species richness, composition and rank abundances, but significant variation in individual species abundances. Fluctuations in relative abundances were significantly affected by variables reflecting the severity of summer droughts and the occurrence of rainy springs. These patterns were evident at the basin scale, while variability at individual stream reaches tended to be higher and less related to rainfall patterns. 3. At least three response guilds to rainfall variation could be identified: two of the four abundant and widespread species (chub and loach) declined following dry years, whereas the two other core species (nase and eel) declined after rainy spring; one scarce native species (stickleback) increased in dry years. 4. Except at the two most upstream reaches, the assemblages tended to recover quickly to previous configuration after the changes occurring during the sequence of dry years. 5. Temporal variability of local assemblages was concordant among reaches but did not follow any consistent spatial pattern. Instead, spatial patterns in assemblage attributes changed over time in response to environmental variability, with a tendency for a disruption of upstream--downstream gradients following dry years. 6. Results supported the view that present-day droughts cause relatively small and transient changes to Mediterranean stream fish assemblages. However, longer and more severe droughts expected under altered future climates, may result in declines or local extinctions of the most sensitive species and their potential replacement by more resistant species. Changing drought regimes thus need to be duly considered in the development of conservation strategies for Mediterranean stream fish.},

Among the tools used to assess resource use, stable isotope analysis has proliferated in ecological studies, particularly in relation to describing intra- and interspecific variation in trophic interactions. Despite a growing need to disseminate scientific information, the inherent limitations of stable isotope ratios and inappropriate synonymizing of distinct evolutionary and ecological processes may mislead ecological inferences in natural systems. This situation necessitates a re-evaluation of the utility of stable isotope ratios to address certain ecological questions. Here, we assess the efficacy of stable isotope ratios to describe two fundamental ecological processes, niche partitioning and individual specialization. Investigation of these processes has increased substantially in accordance with increased access to stable isotope data. This article discusses the circumstances and approaches that are necessary to evaluate niche partitioning and individual specialization, and outlines key considerations for the associated application of stable isotope ratios.},

We briefly review the history of theoretical and empirical perspectives on community change, and propose a new framework for viewing temporal trajectories of communities in multivariate space. We used a stream fish dataset spanning 40~years (1969--2008) in southern Oklahoma, USA, emphasizing our own 1981--2008 collections which included well-documented, extreme drought and flood events, to assess dynamics of and environmental factors affecting the fish community. We evaluated the trajectory of the Brier Creek community in multivariate space relative to trajectories in 27 published studies, and for Brier Creek fish, tested hypotheses about gradual versus event-driven changes and persistence of shifts to alternate states. Most species were persistent, qualitatively, across the four decades, but varied widely in abundance, with some having unusually strong reproduction after extreme droughts. The community had an early period of relatively gradual and directional change, but greater displacement than predicted at random after two consecutive extreme droughts midway through the study (1998 and 2000). But, the community subsequently returned toward its former state in the last decade. This fish community is characterized by species that are tolerant of environmental extremes, and have life history traits that facilitate population recovery. The community appears ``loosely stable'' about a long-term average condition, but the impacts of the two consecutive droughts were substantial, and may foretell future dynamics of this or other communities in a changed global climate if disturbance events become more frequent or severe.},

The fauna of the stream was dominated numerically by minnows (Cyprinidae), sunfish and black bass (Centrarchidae), and topminnows (Fundulidae). The pool fish fauna of the total 1 km reach (including all 14 pools) was highly consistent throughout the study, despite two major floods. Assemblages in individual pools generally were consistent, but there was more variation within pools than at the scale of the entire reach. Throughout the study, most individual pools remained within discrete subsets of the total occupied multivariate space in a principal components analysis based on fish species abundances. Sunfishes (Lepomis spp.) and bass (Micropterus spp.) were more consistent in their distribution among pools than were minnows (Cyprinidae) or a topminnow (Fundulus). There were 25 significant correlations in occurrence of species pairs among stream pools, out of 91 possible comparisons of the 14 most abundant taxa in the reach. Many pools contained assemblages either dominated by large centrarchids or by abundant cyprinids and juvenile centrarchids, but intermediate assemblages also were observed. The dynamics of distribution of fish species and fish assemblages among individual stream pools are likely influenced by a combination of species-specific behaviors and habitat selection, predator constraints on use of individual pools by small fishes, riffles as size-selective barriers to fish movements between pools, dispersal of young-of-the-year fishes, and abiotic phenomena like floods. Individual stream pools appear to be discrete habitat units for fishes, and do represent an appropriate scale for biologically meaningful studies of fish assemblages or their effects on streams.},

  abstract = {Density-dependent dispersal can be caused by various mechanisms, from competition inducing individuals to emigrate (positive density-dependence) to social crowding effects impeding free movement (negative density-dependence). Various spatial population models have incorporated positively density-dependent dispersal algorithms, and recent theoretical models have explored the conditions for density-dependent dispersal (DD) to evolve. However, while the existence of DD is well documented in some taxa such as insects, there is no clear picture on its generality in vertebrates. Here I review the available empirical data on DD in birds and mammals, focusing mainly on variation in dispersal between years and on experimental density manipulations. Surprisingly few studies have explicitly focused on DD, and interpretation of the available data is often hampered by differences in approach, small sample sizes and/or statistical shortcomings. Positive DD was reported in 50 and 33\% of the selected mammal and bird studies, respectively, while two studies on mammals (out of eight) reported negative DD. Among bird studies, DD was more often reported for emigration rates or long-distance recoveries than for average distances within finite study areas. Experimental studies manipulating densities (mainly on mammals) have consistently generated positive DD, typically showing reduced emigration in response to partial population removal. Studies that examined dispersal in relation to seasonal changes in density (small mammals only) have more often reported negative DD. Studies that compared dispersal between sites differing in density, also show a mixture of positive and negative DD. This suggests that dispersal changes in a more complex way with seasonal and spatial density variation than with annual densities, and/or that these results are confounded by other factors differing between seasons and sites, such as habitat quality. I conclude that both correlational and experimental studies support the existence of positive, rather than negative, density-dependent dispersal in birds and mammals.},

Displacement distance of each species were presented and discussed considering seasonal (rainy and dry) and body size patterns. We marked 10 species along the stream and recaptured 440 (34.6\%) of the 1,270 marked fishes. The species with significant number of upstream moving individuals were Astyanax janeiroensis, Characidium interruptum, Astyanax hastatus, Parotocinclus maculicauda and Awaous tajasica. Only Pimelodella lateristriga presented significant differences between resident and moving individuals. Characidium interruptum and A. tajasica demonstrated greater downstream and upstream movement, respectively, moving up to 2,100 m. Even after controlling for species identity we found no significant correlation between fish length and individual displacement distance. Fishes moved longer distances during the rainy season, in accordance to the breeding season. Patterns of fish movement were in agreement to life-history traits of many of the studied species and can be reflecting specific behaviour and morphologies.},

The models are parameterized using allometric relationships specific to four fish life history strategies, constraining the model to biologically plausible regions in parameter space. Using a coupled consumer-resource competition model, I get the paradoxical result that two populations can coexist in equilibrium on an identical resource base, without recourse to temporal or spatial partitioning. In contrast to much theory on limiting similarity, the model also predicts that fish populations of similar life history strategies can coexist in equilibrium with complete resource overlap. This form of coexistence (called density-dependent coexistence) requires that life history strategies differ such that an advantage at one stage of the life cycle implies a disadvantage at another stage in the life cycle. These exact life history trade-offs appear in small-bodied fish. Furthermore, it is postulated that this result may be applicable to other taxa.},

Little is known about the ecology of UTC, but they typically have negative effects on salmonids in systems where they have been introduced. We sought to fill knowledge gaps in UTC ecology and provide insight on potential interactions with Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (YCT) Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri. Ninety-four YCT and 95 UTC were radio-tagged in spring 2019 and 2020 to better understand potential interactions between YCT and UTC in Henrys Lake. Fish were located via mobile tracking and fixed receivers from June to December 2019 and 2020. In June of both years, YCT and UTC were concentrated in nearshore habitats. As water temperatures increased, UTC were documented in deeper water (mean {\textpm} SD = 3.6 {\textpm} 1.4 m) and YCT became more concentrated in areas with cold water (e.g., mouths of tributaries, in-lake springs). In July and August, large congregations of UTC were observed. Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout were detected in tributaries from June to August, but no UTC were detected in the tributaries. By late fall (November--December), YCT were located along the shoreline and UTC were detected in the middle of the lake. Both YCT and UTC were observed in areas with dense vegetation. Macrophytes likely provided a food source for UTC and cover from predators for both species. Locations of YCT were negatively related to warm water temperatures, whereas UTC were positively associated with warm water temperatures. Results from this research fill knowledge gaps in UTC and YCT interactions as well as provide valuable insight on the ecology of UTC and adfluvial Cutthroat Trout populations. Furthermore, distribution patterns and habitat selectivity of YCT and UTC in Henrys Lake can be used to inform management decisions for fishery improvement and YCT conservation.},

Smolting is an adaptive specialization for downstream migration, seawater entry, and marine residence. While still in fresh water, smolts become silvery and streamlined, lose their positive rheotaxis and territoriality, and begin schooling. Physiological changes include increased salinity tolerance, olfactory sensitivity, metabolic rate, scope for growth, and altered hemoglobin and visual pigments. Through their impact on the neuroendocrine system, photoperiod and temperature regulate physiological changes, whereas temperature and water flow may initiate migration. Smolt survival is affected by a limited period of readiness (a physiological "smolt window") and the timing of seawater entry with environmental conditions such as temperature, food, and predators (an ecological "smolt window"). Smolt development is adversely affected by acidity, pollutants, and improper rearing conditions, and is often more sensitive than other life stages. Unfortunately, the migration corridor of smolts (mainstems of rivers and estuaries) are the most heavily impacted by pollution, dams, and other anthropogenic activities that may be directly lethal or increase mortality by delaying or inhibiting smolt migration.}

Whole-population experiments with pupfish Cyprinodon macularius that linked all factors along this resource to population continuum lend support to this conceptual model, and illustrate that emigration may be much more common in fish populations than considered in most individual- or population-based models. Accommodating emigration can enhance the ecological appropriateness of behavioural experiments and increase confidence in extrapolation of experimental observations to population-level effects. New experimental designs and advancing technologies offer avenues for assessing population consequences of habitat selection and emigration by individual fish. Emigration often is the key linkage between individual behaviour and population responses, and greater understanding of the underlying factors affecting this often-overlooked demographic parameter could offer new approaches for management and conservation of fishes.},

We know from much previous work that dispersal can cause such abundance distortions. However, almost all previous theoretical studies have only considered one species alone or two interacting species (e.g. competitors or predator and prey). Moreover, a systematic analysis is needed of whether different dispersal strategies (e.g. passive dispersal versus demographic habitat selection) result in different abundance distortion patterns, how these distortion patterns change with local food web structure, and how the dispersal propensities of the interacting species might evolve in response to one another. In this article, we show using computer simulations and analytical models that abundance distortions occur in simple food webs with both passive dispersal and habitat selection, but habitat selection causes larger distortions. Additionally, patterns in the evolution of dispersal propensity in interacting species are very different for these two dispersal strategies. This study identifies that the dispersal strategies employed by interacting species critically shape how dispersal will influence metacommunity structure.

This analysis demonstrates that a guild of multiple consumers can easily coexist on a single resource if each limits its own abundance to some degree, and stronger intraspecific density dependence permits a wider variety of consumers to coexist. The mechanism permitting multiple consumers to coexist works in a fashion similar to apparent competition or to each consumer having its own specialized predator.

However, populations of many freshwater fishes in the Mediterranean region are threatened by man-\-induced drought due to water diversion. Mark-\-recapture methodology is an effective tool for estimating fish abundance and survival probability, but it has been seldom used with Mediterranean freshwater fish. We tagged over 2,400 individuals of two threatened cyprinids (Mediterranean barbel Barbus meridionalis and Catalan chub Squalius laietanus) inhabiting an Iberian stream affected by water diversion, and used mark-\-recapture methods to evaluate the effects of flow, temperature and depth on their apparent survival and abundance at hydrologically altered and perennial reaches. Based on estimates over the summer drying season, survival of Mediterranean barbel was more than six times higher in an upstream reach with permanent flow than a middle reach impacted by water diversion. Water depth was the most important habitat feature accounting for differences in survival, with both barbel and chub exhibiting higher survival and abundance at permanent sites farther downstream where flow had been restored and in an unaltered tributary. Our results show clear negative impacts of water diversion on fish populations. Both species, but particularly barbel, have life-\-cycle characteristics that may allow populations to recover quickly if natural streamflow was restored by conserving water and reducing water diversion.},

  abstract = {The restricted area of space used by most mobile animals is thought to result from fitness-rewarding decisions derived from gaining information about the environment. Yet, assessments of how animals deal with uncertainty using memory have been largely theoretical, and an empirically derived mechanism explaining restricted space use in animals is still lacking. Using a patch-to-patch movement analysis, we investigated predictions of how free-ranging bison (Bison bison) living in a meadow-forest matrix use memory to reduce uncertainty in energy intake rate. Results indicate that bison remembered pertinent information about location and quality of meadows, and they used this information to selectively move to meadows of higher profitability. Moreover, bison chose profitable meadows they had previously visited, and this choice was stronger after visiting a relatively poor quality meadow. Our work demonstrates a link between memory, energy gains and restricted space use while establishing a fitness-based integration of movement, cognitive and spatial ecology.},

Annual retention rates for PIT tags averaged 81\% among all study streams, ranging from a low of 67\% to a high of 92\%. Annual retention rates were lower for larger rainbow trout than for their smaller counterparts. Long-term tag loss for females was the same as for males for fish smaller than 15 cm but significantly higher for fish 15 cm or more, suggesting that egg expulsion was the primary cause of tag loss.

In this setting, it is believed that the coexistence of all species requires their traits to satisfy restrictive conditions limiting their similarity. To investigate whether diverse metacommunities can assemble in a CC trade-off model, we study their assembly from a probabilistic perspective. From a pool of species with parameters (corresponding to traits) sampled at random, we compute the probability that any number of species coexist and characterize the set of species that emerges through assembly. Remarkably, almost exactly half of the species in a large pool typically coexist, with no saturation as the size of the pool grows, and with little dependence on the underlying distribution of traits. Through a mix of analytical results and simulations, we show that this unlimited niche packing emerges as assembly actively moves communities toward overdispersed configurations in niche space. Our findings also apply to a realistic assembly scenario where species invade one at a time from a fixed regional pool. When diversity arises de novo in the metacommunity, richness still grows without bound, but more slowly. Together, our results suggest that the CC trade-off can support the robust emergence of diverse communities, even when coexistence of the full species pool is exceedingly unlikely.},

To fully understand these new developments, however, students continue to need a strong foundation in the study of species interactions and how these interactions are assembled into food webs and other ecological networks. This new edition fulfils the book's original aims, both as a much-needed up-to-date and accessible introduction to modern community ecology, and in identifying the important questions that are yet to be answered. This research-driven textbook introduces state-of-the-art community ecology to a new generation of students, adopting reasoned and balanced perspectives on as-yet-unresolved issues.

  abstract = {A foraging model was developed to predict the optimal diet breadth and maximum energetic intake of a given-sized fish foraging in each of three aquatic habitats: the open water, vegetation, and bare sediments. Model parameters of prey encounter rates and prey handling times were quantified as functions of fish size, prey density, and prey size through a series of laboratory feeding experiments using the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Results of these experiments show both searching ability and prey handling efficiency to increase with increasing fish size. Predictions of prey size selection and optimal habitat use based upon maximizing energetic gain were then examined in a small Michigan lake for three size classes of bluegills. Bluegills {$>$} 100 mm standard length were highly size selective in their feeding and their diets closely matched predictions of an optimal diet model. From two estimates of relative prey visibilities I show that these fish selected larger prey items than would be predicted if prey were consumed "as encountered." Habitat use of large bluegills was also shown to maximize foraging return as fish switched from utilizing vegetation-living prey to utilizing open-water zooplankton as relative foraging profitabilities in the two habitats changed across the summer. Bluegills {$<$}100 mm standard length were restricted in their habitat use, remaining in or near the vegetation despite demonstrated increases in foraging return available in the open-water habitat. Size-related predation risk apparently accounts for differences in habitat use between bluegill size classes, and its consequences for intra- and interspecific competition between size classes are discussed.}

  abstract = {Inter-specific interactions are key factors in the structuring and functioning of ecological communities. Therefore, it is necessary to assess species interactions, such as predator--prey dynamics and competitive exclusion, within the context of continuing global species introductions. The aim of the present study was to assess ecological impacts and competitive exclusion dynamics involving co-occurring introduced and native fish species, using the multiple predator functional response (FR) approach. We use comparative FR analysis (resource uptake as a function of resource density) to assess inter-specific interactions between the invasive western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis and the native freshwater river goby Glossogobius callidus towards chironomid larvae. The FR was derived for each fish species as individuals and when in heterospecific pairings. Data from single individuals were used to predict the expected FR of individuals when in heterospecific multiple predator combinations. Expected FRs were then compared to the observed FRs of each predator in combination trials, enumerated using prey items in their gut contents. Both fish species displayed Type II FRs, however, in single fish trials, invasive mosquitofish had significantly higher FRs (curve asymptotes; i.e. shorter handling times and higher maximum feeding rates) than native river gobies. Heterospecific mosquitofish-river goby combinations revealed that the FR of the river goby was reduced (i.e. longer handling times and lower maximum feeding rates) by the presence of mosquitofish, whereas this combination greatly enhanced mosquitofish FR magnitudes (i.e. shorter handling times and higher maximum feeding rates). The heterospecific treatments resulted in neutral impacts on prey and there were clear inter-species interference in favour of the non-native mosquitofish. This study demonstrates how multiple predators can alter the shape of individual FRs, with neutral effects on prey but superior invader competitive ability. This has implications for predicting the naturalisation success of invasive predators, as predatory and competitive interactions with native predators and prey may facilitate rather than impede establishment.},

  abstract = {Using geospatial data of wildlife presence to predict a species distribution across a geographic area is among the most common tools in management and conservation. The collection of high-quality presence--absence (PA) data through structured surveys is, however, expensive, and managers usually have access to larger amounts of low-quality presence-only (PO) data collected by citizen scientists, opportunistic observations and culling returns for game species. Integrated species distribution models (ISDMs) have been developed to make the most of the data available by combining the higher-quality, but usually scarcer and more spatially restricted, PA data with the lower-quality, unstructured, but usually more extensive PO datasets. Joint-likelihood ISDMs can be run in a Bayesian context using integrated nested laplace approximation methods that allow the addition of a spatially structured random effect to account for data spatial autocorrelation. Here, we apply this innovative approach to fit ISDMs to empirical data, using PA and PO data for the three prevalent deer species in Ireland: red, fallow and sika deer. We collated all deer data available for the past 15 years and fitted models predicting distribution and relative abundance at a 25 km2 resolution across the island. Model predictions were associated to spatial estimate of uncertainty, allowing us to assess the quality of the model and the effect that data scarcity has on the certainty of predictions. Furthermore, we checked the performance of the three species-specific models using two datasets, independent deer hunting returns and deer densities based on faecal pellet counts. Our work clearly demonstrates the applicability of spatially explicit ISDMs to empirical data in a Bayesian context, providing a blueprint for managers to exploit unexplored and seemingly unusable data that can, when modelled with the proper tools, serve to inform management and conservation policies.},

In this study, we examined the usefulness of both methods to assess the impact of exotic trout on native charr. 2 Brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss have been introduced world-wide. They are invading many streams in Japan that also harbour native salmonids. We studied these species and the endemic Asian white-spotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis in the Hekirichi River, south-western Hokkaido, Japan. We estimated the densities of all three species in pools and riffles from 27 stream reaches over 2 successive years. Data were analysed by regression and isodar methods to infer interspecific interactions. 3 The regression method identified a negative relationship between brown trout and white-spotted charr densities, implying that brown trout are replacing white-spotted charr. 4 The isodar method identified significant competition for habitat between rainbow trout and white-spotted charr. This method suggested that white-spotted charr preferred pools to riffles when rainbow trout were scarce but moved from pools to riffles as trout density in the pools increased. 5 Synthesis and applications. Although they are based on limited data, regression and isodar methods were able to evaluate the potential impact of exotic trout on native white-spotted charr. From these results, we were able to hypothesize mechanisms of displacement of native charr by exotic trout. However, according to the two methods the mechanisms underlying the negative impacts on charr differ between brown and rainbow trout; in other words, limitations exist for both methods. From a more practical viewpoint, the analyses conducted in this study may be useful tools for conservation biologists who have limitations on their time and effort but must assess the impacts of exotics on native species.},

In particular, it is important to understand the patterns and drivers of spatial variation in local community dynamics, generalizing temporal trends from discrete locations to entire landscapes that are the main focus of management. Here, we present a framework for producing spatially continuous views of community dynamics, focusing on stream fish affected by hydropower development. Location River Sabor, NE Portugal. Methods We sampled stream fish at thirty sites between 2012 and 2019. Community trajectory analysis was used to quantify the directionality and velocity of community change, and the geometric resemblance of community trajectories between sites. Geostatistical models for stream networks were used to relate metrics describing community dynamics to environmental variables, while controlling for Euclidean and hydrologic spatial dependencies, and to map spatial variation in community dynamics across the watershed. Results Trajectories in multivariate space underlined strong temporal dynamics, with local communities deviating and returning to previous states, but without evidence for directional changes. Accordingly, directionality values were low and not consistently affected by environmental variables. The velocity of community change varied markedly across the watershed and it was strongly affected by stream order and elevation, with faster changes observed in lowland streams draining into hydroelectric reservoirs and with a high proportion of exotic species. Pairwise distances between community trajectories were strongly related to hydrologic and environmental distances between sites. Main conclusions Local stream fish communities were in a loose equilibrium across the watershed, but they fluctuated at a faster rate closer to a hydroelectric reservoir. Integrating community trajectory analysis and geostatistical modelling provides a relatively simple framework to understand how, where and why temporal community dynamics vary across dendritic stream networks and to visualize spatial patterns of community change over time in relation to anthropogenic impacts.},

Since that time, our knowledge of California's freshwater fishes has dramatically increased. This completely revised edition incorporates a vast amount of new information and creates a fresh synthesis of the historical data. Written by the leading expert on California's freshwater fishes and illustrated with beautiful line drawings, this compendium is the single best source for understanding and identifying the state's freshwater fishes. It is an essential resource for anyone who needs to have accurate and detailed information on California's fishes at their fingertips. Since the 1870s, the state's native fishes have been joined by thirty-four alien species, which now dominate many bodies of water. This book treats both native and introduced species, first in a key for identification, and then in individual species accounts covering characteristics, taxonomy, names, distribution, and life history. Each account includes the author's personal assessment of how well the species is doing and problems associated with its management. Most of the native fishes are found only in California and show many wonderful adaptations for living in the state's diverse waters. Unfortunately, many are also in danger of extinction. The message underlying the first edition of this book was that we knew astonishingly little about many of California's inland fishes. Although our knowledge is increasing, full accounts of some native fishes may not be complete before they become extinct. Preventing the loss of native fishes is the major goal of this book, and Moyle makes important suggestions for conservation strategies as well as presenting up-to-date information on ecology, life history, and distribution. With this knowledge, preserving our native fishes becomes possible even in the face of the state's growing economy and population.},

  abstract = {Lake Ontario supports a diversity of native and non-native salmonids which are managed largely through stocking practices. Ecological changes (e.g., invasive species) altering the food web structure accompanied with shifts in prey abundance, necessitate understanding the trophic niches of Lake Ontario salmonids to aid in management. The objectives of this study were to quantify salmonid (5 species) trophic niches and dietary proportions using stable isotope ratios ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N) of a large sample set (adult fish ({$>$}300\,mm; n\,=\,672) and key offshore prey (5 species, n\,=\,2037)) collected across Lake Ontario in 2013. Estimates of prey based on stable isotope ratios were similar to stomach contents. Based on stable isotope ratios, non-native prey dominated salmonid diet; in particular alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) constituted the majority (0.31 to 0.93) of all salmonid diets, and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) contributed 0.26 and 0.19 of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) diets, respectively. Trophic niche overlap was high between all salmonids, except lake trout. The largest trophic niche overlap occurred between Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and their reliance on alewife infers a strong pelagic foraging strategy. Lake, brown and rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss) trout had larger and/or more distinct trophic niches indicative of a more variable diet across individuals and utilizing different foraging strategies and/or habitats. Overall, Lake Ontario salmonids maintained a high reliance on alewife, and their potential for plasticity in diet provides important information to management regarding population sustainability.},

  abstract = {Fine-scale underwater telemetry affords an unprecedented opportunity to understand how aquatic animals respond to environmental changes. We investigated the movement patterns of an aquatic top predator, Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), using a three-dimensional acoustic telemetry system installed in Kleiner D{\"o}llnsee (25 ha), a small, shallow, mesotrophic natural lake. Adult piscivorous perch (N = 16) were tagged and tracked in the whole lake at a minimum of 9-s intervals over the course of one year. Perch increased swimming activity with higher water temperature and light intensity. Air pressure, wind speed and lunar phase also explained perch movements, but the effects were substantially smaller compared to temperature and light. Perch showed a strong diel pattern in activity, with farther swimming distances and larger activity spaces during the daytime, compared to the night-time. To investigate the influence of prey distribution, we sampled the prey fish in both littoral and pelagic zones in both day and night monthly using gill nets. We found that the prey fish underwent diel horizontal migration, using the littoral zone during the day and the pelagic zone during the night. However, perch showed the opposite patterns, suggesting either that the prey fish avoided predation risk or that the horizontal diel migration of perch was driven by other mechanisms. Our results collectively suggest that the movement ecology of piscivorous perch is mainly governed by a foraging motivation as a function of abiotic variables, especially temperature and light.},

  abstract = {Movements of the Japanese fluvial sculpin Cottus pollux were studied over a 2-year period using a mark-recapture technique in two reaches (100 and 300 m) of a small, temperate stream system, the Fujii River, Japan. Of 321 recaptures, 62 fish (19.3\%) moved across at least one riffle (i.e., were ``mobile''). Fish moved distances of up to 192 m (median = 4 m). Distance moved (m) by all fish correlated positively with the recapture interval (d) in both years, illustrating the importance of the temporal dimension for movements. Mean daily distance moved (m/d) in the high-flow year was greater than that in the low-flow year. The high-flow year, which had a higher frequency of peak flow events, had a higher frequency of mobile fish than did the low-flow year, suggesting that interannual variation in movements is related to streamflow. Fish size and growth did not differ between mobile fish and residents in the high-flow year; however, mobile fish were larger and grew more slowly than residents in the low-flow year. Patterns of movement from multiple recaptures showed evidence for round-trip movements at channel unit and reach scales, but no fish completed round-trip movements by crossing a small weir ({$<$}0.5 m in height). These results emphasize the importance of maintaining fish passage and pool-riffle sequences throughout the stream course to prevent isolation of subpopulations by weirs, culverts, and road crossings. Physical barriers to Japanese fluvial sculpin movements could be mitigated by placing a ramp of cobbles downstream of the barriers.}

The original measure had been derived from an insightful phenomenological model and is based on the leading eigenvalue of a suitable landscape matrix. It yields a versatile predictor of metapopulation persistence through a threshold value of the eigenvalue determined by ecological features of the focal species. Here, we present an analytical solution to a fundamental microscopic model that incorporates key ingredients of metapopulation dynamics and explicitly distinguishes between individuals comprising the ``settled population'' and ``explorers'' seeking colonization. Our approach accounts for general network characteristics (in particular graph-driven directional dispersal which is known to significantly constrain many ecological estimates) and yields a generalized version of the original model, to which it reduces for particular cases. Through examples, including real landscapes used as the template, we compare the predictions from our approach with those of the standard model. Results suggest that in several cases of practical interest, differences are significant. We also examine, with both models, how changes in habitat fragmentation, including removal, addition, or alteration in size, affect metapopulation persistence. The current approach demonstrates a high level of flexibility, enabling the incorporation of diverse ``microscopic'' elements and their impact on the resulting biodiversity landscape pattern.},

  abstract = {River managers strive to use the best available science to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem function. To achieve this goal requires consideration of processes at different scales. Metacommunity theory describes how multiple species from different communities potentially interact with local-scale environmental drivers to influence population dynamics and community structure. However, this body of knowledge has only rarely been used to inform management practices for river ecosystems. In this article, we present a conceptual model outlining how the metacommunity processes of local niche sorting and dispersal can influence the outcomes of management interventions and provide a series of specific recommendations for applying these ideas as well as research needs. In all cases, we identify situations where traditional approaches to riverine management could be enhanced by incorporating an understanding of metacommunity dynamics. A common theme is developing guidelines for assessing the metacommunity context of a site or region, evaluating how that context may affect the desired outcome, and incorporating that understanding into the planning process and methods used. To maximize the effectiveness of management activities, scientists, and resource managers should update the toolbox of approaches to riverine management to reflect theoretical advances in metacommunity ecology.

Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the seasonal and diel differences in movement rates, site fidelity, and home range of bluegills in a shallow, natural Great Plains lake. A total of 78 bluegills (200--273 mm total length) were implanted with radio transmitters in March and May 2000. Of these fish, 10 males and 10 females were randomly selected and located every 2 h during one 24-h period each month from April to September 2000. Bluegill movement peaked during midsummer; however, there was little difference in diel movements, suggesting relatively consistent movement throughout the 24-h period. Home range estimates (which included the 24-h tracking plus an additional six locations from the same fish located once per day for six consecutive days each month) ranged up to 172 ha, probably because only about half of the bluegills exhibited site fidelity during any month sampled. Bluegill movement did not appear to be strongly linked with water temperature, barometric pressure, or wind speed. These results suggest that bluegills move considerable distances and that many roam throughout this 332-ha shallow lake. However, diel patterns were not evident. Sampling bluegills in Great Plains lakes using passive gears (e.g., trap nets) may be most effective during the summer months, when fish are most active. Active sampling (e.g., electrofishing) may be more effective than the use of passive gears in spring and fall, when bluegills are less active.},

In contrast, little is known about how temperature influences ectotherm performance in the wild, so the ecological significance of physiological performance as measured in the laboratory is unclear. Our aim was to measure the temperature dependence of performance in the wild for several species of fishes and to explore how temperatures that maximize performance in the wild (ToptE) are related to species biogeographies. We gathered body activity and growth data from the wild for nine tropical and temperate fish species, and by fitting thermal performance curves to these data, compared ToptE to species-specific warm range boundary temperatures (the average temperature of the warmest month at equatorward range limits). To explore the degree to which trends in the wild reflect trends in physiological performance measured in the laboratory, we also compiled published data on the temperature dependence of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and compared these to our wild fish data. We found ToptE in the wild was strongly correlated with warm range boundary temperatures, and that the difference between these two temperatures (the `environmental heating tolerance') was smaller for more-tropical species. Comparison with laboratory data revealed that ToptE approaches warm boundary temperatures in the wild at the same rate that the optimal temperature for aerobic scope (ToptAS) approaches upper critical temperatures (upper Tcrit) for aerobic scope in the laboratory, meaning that environmental heating tolerances in wild fishes closely mirror physiological heating tolerance (i.e. upper Tcrit - ToptAS) in captive fishes. Our comparison of field- and laboratory-derived data highlights the ecological significance of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and suggests wild fish species tend to perform best near the highest temperatures encountered in their range while maintaining a safety margin from the deleterious effects of upper critical temperatures.},

Yet, to fully understand the rates of intra- and interspecific encounters among individuals, observations at finer spatial and temporal scales might be necessary. We used passive integrated transponder tags and antenna arrays to continuously monitor habitat use and vagility of three stream minnows; southern redbelly dace Chrosomus erythrogaster, central stoneroller Campostoma anomalum, and creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus, among and within pools of an intermittent stream. Most fish remained in the pool where they were caught and released, or returned after emigrating from the pool. Despite largely remaining within the release pool, distribution among four microhabitats differed significantly over six, 4-h time periods for all three species. Vagility, the summed distance moved among antennas, differed significantly among species. Individual vagility (m~day-1) increased significantly with body length for stoneroller and chub, but not dace. Some individuals moved as much as 110~m~day-1 within the pool, showcasing extensive movement at fine scales. Finally, we found no evidence that feeding activity changed as a result of differential habitat use over a 24-h period. Our findings indicate considerable variation in habitat use and movement occurs among species over a 24-h period. This suggests ecologists can broaden the interpretation of processes influencing community structure (e.g., resource partitioning, avoidance of predators) by quantifying species distributions across a range of spatial and temporal scales.},

This study presents a modeling framework based on dispersal kernels (modified Laplace distributions) that describe stream fish dispersal in the presence of obstacles to passage. We used mark--recapture trials to quantify summer dispersal of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in four streams crossed by a highway. The analysis identified population heterogeneity in dispersal behavior, as revealed by the presence of a dominant sedentary component (48--72\% of all individuals) characterized by short mean dispersal distance (,10 m), and a secondary mobile component characterized by longer mean dispersal distance (56--1086 m). We did not detect evidence of barrier effects on dispersal through highway crossings. Simulation of various plausible scenarios indicated that detectability of barrier effects was strongly dependent on features of sampling design, such as spatial configuration of the sampling area, barrier extent, and sample size. The proposed modeling framework extends conventional dispersal kernels by incorporating structural barriers. A major strength of the approach is that ecological process (dispersal model) and sampling design (observation model) are incorporated simultaneously into the analysis. This feature can facilitate the use of prior knowledge to improve sampling efficiency of mark--recapture trials in movement studies. Model-based estimation of barrier permeability and its associated uncertainty provides a rigorous approach for quantifying the effect of barriers on stream fish dispersal and assessing population dynamics of stream fish in fragmented landscapes.},

We found that each type of land use reduced multiple components of within-stream biodiversity across scales, but that urbanization consistently had the strongest effects. However, we found that {$\beta$}-diversity among streams in modified landscapes did not differ from {$\beta$}-diversity observed among reference streams, suggesting little evidence for biotic homogenization. Nevertheless, assemblage composition did experience considerable species turnover between reference and modified streams. Our results emphasize that to understand how anthropogenic factors such as land use alter biodiversity, multiple components of biodiversity within and among sites must be simultaneously considered at multiple scales.},

Movements were very restricted: median and mean movement distances for all sculpin size classes over a 45 day period were 1.3 and 4.4 m respectively. Nevertheless, there was a high degree of intrapopulation and temporal variation in sculpin movement. Movement of juveniles increased with discharge and with the density of large adults. Movement by small and large adults was not influenced by stream flow, but large adults where more mobile when their own density was high. Finally, there were differences in the growth rates of mobile and sedentary sculpins. Mobile juveniles grew faster than sedentary individuals under conditions of low flow and high density of large adults, whereas adults exhibited the opposite pattern. 3. Our results support the hypothesis that juvenile movement and growth is influenced by both intraspecific interactions with adults and stream flow. In contrast, adult movement appears to be influenced by competitive interactions among residents for suitable space. The relationship between movement and growth may provide a negative feedback mechanism regulating mottled sculpin populations in this system.},

However, these techniques have received little notice from fisheries biologists, despite the widespread applicability to fisheries research, the wide variety of tag types used in fisheries research (from traditional fin clips to telemetry tags), and the development of new computer software to assist with analyses. We present a brief review of population models based on recaptures, returns, or telemetry relocations of tagged fish that can be used to estimate population size, total mortality, and components of mortality (i.e., fishing and natural) that are frequently of interest to fisheries biologists. Recommended strategies include (1) use closed population models (e.g., Lincoln-Peterson) to estimate population size for short term studies where closure assumption can be met, (2) use the robust design to estimate population size for studies of longer duration, (3) use high-reward tags in conjunction with other methods of estimating reporting rate in tag-return studies, (4) combine a subset of telemetry tagged fish with either a high-reward tagging program or a traditional capture-recapture study to improve mortality estimates and understanding of mortality components, and (5) use pilot studies and simulation analyses to assess precision of estimated parameters to evaluate study feasibility. Incorporation of these improved techniques could lead to greater accuracy and precision of parameter estimates from tagging studies and thus to improved understanding and management of fish populations.},

In this paper, using oak assemblages distributed across the continental United States obtained from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), we assessed the performance of stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs), constructed using satellite remote sensing as covariates and under a Bayesian framework, in order to build the next-generation of biodiversity models. This study represents an attempt to evaluate the integrated predictions of biodiversity models---including assemblage diversity and composition---obtained by stacking next-generation SDMs. We found three main results. First, environmental predictors derived entirely from satellite remote sensing represent adequate covariates for biodiversity modeling. Second, applying constraints to assemblage predictions, such as imposing the probability ranking rule, not necessarily results in more accurate species diversity predictions. Third, independent of the stacking procedure (bS-SDM versus pS-SDM versus cS-SDM), this kind of biodiversity models do not accurately recover the observed species composition at plot level or ecological scales (NEON plots), however, they do return reasonable predictions at macroecological scales, i.e., mid to high correct assignment of species identities at the scale of NEON sites. Our results provide insights for the prediction of assemblage diversity and composition at different spatial scales. An important task for future studies is to evaluate the reliability of combining S-SDMs with direct detection of species using image spectroscopy to build a new generation of biodiversity models to accurately predict and monitor ecological assemblages through time and space.},

  abstract = {Based on a marginal value approach, we derive a nonlinear expression for evolutionarily stable (ES) dispersal rates in a metapopulation with global dispersal. For the general case of density-dependent population growth, our analysis shows that individual dispersal rates should decrease with patch capacity and---beyond a certain threshold--increase with population density. We performed a number of spatially explicit, individual-based simulation experiments to test these predictions and to explore further the relevance of variation in the rate of population increase, density dependence, environmental fluctuations and dispersal mortality on the evolution of dispersal rates. They confirm the predictions of our analytical approach. In addition, they show that dispersal rates in metapopulations mostly depend on dispersal mortality and inter-patch variation in population density. The latter is dominantly driven by environmental fluctuations and the rate of population increase. These conclusions are not altered by the introduction of neighbourhood dispersal. With patch capacities in the order of 100 individuals, kin competition seems to be of negligible importance for ES dispersal rates except when overall dispersal rates are low.},

We take the case of delayed predator-induced dispersal (PID) in aphids to explore in which way current environmental conditions may be utilized as an appropriate signal for dispersal decisions. In aphids, the presence of predators triggers the production of winged offspring that may later leave the plant and shift their center of activity permanently. Using individual-based simulations as well as analytical approximations, we explore under which conditions PID is likely to evolve. We demonstrate that this requires substantial temporal correlation in predation risk and weak competition among prey; these conditions may be fulfilled in the aphid system. We discuss the analogy between the specific case of PID and the evolution of conditional emigration in the face of spatiotemporally correlated deterioration in reproduction or survival.},

  abstract = {Conceptual and methodological tools from behavioral ecology can inform studies of habitat quality, and their potential for evaluating habitat restoration in conservation efforts is explored here. Such approaches provide mechanistic detail in understanding the relationship between organisms and their habitats and are thus more informative than correlations between density and habitat characteristics. Several Pacific salmon species have been the target of habitat restoration efforts for the past 2--3 decades, but most post-restoration effectiveness studies have been limited to correlative data described above. In mark--recapture assays from four different study years, the affinity of sub-yearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) for stream pools restored with or created by engineered log structures was greater than that for pools without restoration, though with high interannual variability. From corresponding distribution and density data, it was clear that habitat affinity data are not always concordant with single observations of density. The same was true of the correlation between either affinity or density and physical characteristics of pools, although depth and current velocity had some explanatory power for both responses in Chinook. Movement into pools by Chinook during the assays indicated that restored pools can support more immigrants at a given density than can unrestored pools; however, no such pattern emerged for steelhead. Variation among individuals in body condition has implications for population-wide fitness, and such low variation was correlated with stronger affinity for pools in Chinook regardless of restoration status. This suggests that pools may mediate habitat-related trade-offs and that restoring them might have a positive effect on fitness. Thus affinity, immigration, and condition data give much-needed mechanistic indication of habitat selection for restored habitat via an apparent capacity increase and those potential fitness benefits. This is stronger support for restoration effectiveness than density differences alone because density data (1) may simply indicate redistribution of fish from poor to good habitats and (2) are not adequate to show correlations between restoration and positive change in traits correlated with fitness.},

  abstract = {A primary goal of ecology is to understand the fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions of species. Two major strands of ecology -- habitat modelling and community ecology -- approach this problem differently. Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify the relationship between species' and their environments without considering potential biotic interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies, use co-occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes. Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that integrates these distinct observational approaches by incorporating species co-occurrence data into a SDM. JSDMs estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and allow decomposition of species co-occurrence patterns into components describing shared environmental responses and residual patterns of co-occurrence. We provide a general description of the model, a tutorial and code for fitting the model in R. We demonstrate this modelling approach using two case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria, Australia. Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than residual correlations for both frogs and eucalypts, but there were cases of strong residual correlation. Frog species generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to the fact these species occurred in similar habitats that were not fully described by the environmental variables included in the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar environmental responses but had negative residual co-occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species may not form stable assemblages despite having similar environmental affinities. Environmental and residual correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether co-occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic interactions), or if important predictor variables are missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions of species might be related to each other and thus overcome a major limitation of modelling species distributions independently.},

This research aims at studying the space and time variation of fish community structure in the Seti Gandaki River, Tanahu, Nepal. The field survey was conducted from July 2017 to June 2018 and the fishes were sampled from six sites using a medium size cast net of mesh size ranging from 3 mm to 6 mm mesh size, 25-33 feet length and 3.5-5 feet width, with the help of local fisher man. A total of 1,440 individuals were caught representing 46 species belonging to three order, nine families and 23 genera. The analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed significant difference in space (R = 0.824, P = 0.001) but not in time (R = 0.135, P = 0.021). On the basis of similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis, 85.43\% similarity was found among the seasons and major contributing species were Barilius bendelisis (8.44\%) followed by B. vagra (7.79\%), Tor putitora (7.27\%), Garra gotyla (7\%), Acanthocobotis botia (6.7\%), Neolissochilus hexagonolepis (6.64\%), Barilius shacra (6\%), B. barila (4.5\%) and Opsarius barna (4.37\%).

Muddy Creek, in south-central Wyoming (Little Snake River watershed), contains sympatric populations of native roundtail chub (Gila robusta), bluehead sucker, (Catostomus discobolus), and flannelmouth sucker (C. latipinnis), and represents an area of high conservation concern because it is the only area known to have sympatric populations of all 3 species in Wyoming. However, introduced creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) are abundant and might have a negative influence on native fishes. We assessed summer food habits of roundtail chub and creek chub to provide information on the ecology of each species and obtain insight on potential trophic overlap. Roundtail chub and creek chub seemed to be opportunistic generalists that consumed a diverse array of food items. Stomach contents of both species were dominated by plant material, aquatic and terrestrial insects, and fishes, but also included gastropods and mussels. Stomach contents were similar between species, indicating high trophic overlap. No length-related patterns in diet were observed for either species. These results suggest that creek chubs have the potential to adversely influence the roundtail chub population through competition for food and the native fish assemblage through predation. /// Peces nativos de Upper Colorado River Basin han experimentado una decadencia substancial en abundancia y distribuci{\'o}n, y han sido eliminados de la mayor parte del Estado de Wyoming.

We demonstrate the model using 2010 data for anadromous American shad ( Alosa sapidissima) tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT) at a weir near the mouth of a North Carolina river and passively monitored with an upstream array of PIT antennas. The river channel constrained migrations, resulting in linear, one-dimensional encounter histories that included both weir captures and antenna detections. Individual activity centres in a given time period were a function of the individual's previous estimated location and the river conditions (i.e., gage height). Model results indicate high within-river spawning mortality (mean weekly survival = 0.80) and more extensive movements during elevated river conditions. This model is applicable for any linear array (e.g., rivers, shorelines, and corridors), opening new opportunities to study demographic parameters, movement or migration, and habitat use. (English)},

This is the first comprehensive quantitative meta-analysis of heterogeneous freshwater fish movement, aiming to determine mobile and stationary shares of fish communities, their dispersal distances and key predictors of dispersal patterns. By reviewing and analysing 160 empirical data sets from 71 studies covering 62 fishes in streams, it goes beyond previous studies of salmonids' heterogeneous movement. Based on fitted leptokurtic dispersal kernels, the movement distances of (i) a stationary component ({$\sigma$}stat) and (ii) a mobile component ({$\sigma$}mob) as well as the (iii) share of each component (p) were calculated. The median movement distance of the stationary and mobile component of a fish population was 36.4 and 361.7 m, respectively. The share of the stationary individuals was high (median = 66.6\%), but unrelated to movement distance. Single and multiple linear regressions as well as mixed-effects models revealed movement distances positively related to fish length, aspect ratio of the caudal fin, stream size and duration of the study. Furthermore, movement distance differed between taxonomic families. The quantitative parameters of heterogeneous fish movement provided are prerequisite to estimate time lags in fish response to river rehabilitation, temporal patterns in species dispersal, and minimum effective size of potential founder populations for species conservation and stock recovery based on minimum numbers of specimen to disperse.},

We studied the fish community in a small subtropical spring lake, Lake Zacapu, for two different decades to analyse its structural characteristics. Sampling was performed every 3 months at four sites from January to October 1995 and from May 2019 to May 2020. We determined the temporal variation (seasonal and decadal) in the fish community structure with respect to composition, abundance, diversity and dominance. We evaluated the association between species and water quality. Our results showed spatial homogeneity in most physicochemical variables that remained in the same range across decades, although some nutrients (NO3) recently increased. All species identified in the early samples were present in the recent surveys (eleven native and two nonnative species), indicating that the fish community composition had significant qualitative stability. However, the dominant littoral cyprinid in 1995 was replaced by the more limnetic atherinopsid in 2019--2020, and the diversity and abundance of sensitive fish decreased in recent samplings. Consequently, the current status of critically endangered species is supported for some restricted and microendemic fish. The changes in the community structure attributes, which show a tendency for reduction in native species, emphasise the need to implement efforts to conserve freshwater fish diversity in small spring lakes.},

Expression of movement behavior has traditionally been termed dispersal and measured relative to home ranges. This simplistic approach belies the complexity of the process. Movement of freshwater stream fish has been at times viewed as predominantly restricted in nature, but recent research challenges this paradigm since some distribution of movement exists in every population. A better research approach is to understand the drivers that promote or limit movement. Drivers of movement can be categorized as extrinsic ecological factors (context dependent), e.g., habitat quality, habitat variability, and the presence of predators, and intrinsic traits of the fish (condition dependent), such as body size and condition. One intrinsic trait that has received relatively little attention is the inherent personality to be sedentary or mobile, and how this interacts with the suite of traits and behaviors to drive movement. Future movement behavior research should focus on the interaction of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers to better understand the evolutionary and ecological implications of movement.},

We studied movements of fantail (Etheostoma flabellare), riverweed (E. podostemone), and Roanoke darters (Percina roanoka) through two stream systems during two summers. We then related movement to variability in measured habitat attributes using logistic regression and exploratory data plots. We indexed habitat conditions at both microhabitat (i.e., patches of uniform depth, velocity, and substrate) and mesohabitat (i.e., riffle and pool channel units) spatial scales, and determined how local habitat conditions were affected by landscape spatial (i.e., longitudinal position, land use) and temporal contexts. Most spatial variability in habitat conditions and fish movement was unexplained by a site's location on the landscape. Exceptions were microhabitat diversity, which was greater in the less-disturbed watershed, and riffle isolation and predator density in pools, which were greater at more-downstream sites. Habitat conditions and movement also exhibited only minor temporal variability, but the relative influences of habitat attributes on movement were quite variable over time. During the first year, movements of fantail and riverweed darters were triggered predominantly by loss of shallow microhabitats; whereas, during the second year, microhabitat diversity was more strongly related (though in opposite directions) to movement of these two species. Roanoke darters did not move in response to microhabitat-scale variables, presumably because of the species' preference for deeper microhabitats that changed little over time. Conversely, movement of all species appeared to be constrained by riffle isolation and predator density in pools, two mesohabitat-scale attributes. Relationships between environmental variability and movement depended on both the spatiotemporal scale of consideration and the ecology of the species. Future studies that integrate across scales, taxa, and life-histories are likely to provide greater insight into movement ecology than will traditional, single-season, single-species approaches.},

  abstract = {We examined the response of stream macroinvertebrates to a multiple-year experimental flood regime downstream of a large reservoir. Benthic samples were collected from the River Sp{\"o}l prior to the initial flood (1999) and at periodic intervals before and after eight floods from 2000 through 2002. Three artificial floods occurred each in 2000 and 2001, and two floods were implemented in 2002. We also sampled macroinvertebrates in an adjacent tributary (Val da l'Aqua) on the same dates as in the Sp{\"o}l to assess the natural temporal variability in assemblage structure. The regulated baseflow discharge in the Sp{\"o}l was {$<$}2.5 m3/s, whereas the floods ranged from 10 m3/s to over 25 m3/s with some flood peaks reaching {$>$}40 m3/s for a short period. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that the floods significantly reduced macroinvertebrate densities in the Sp{\"o}l, although recovery to pre-flood densities occurred within a matter of weeks to densities found in 1999. A principal components analysis revealed that assemblage composition shifted in response to the recurring floods, first from 1999 to 2000 and then from 2000 to 2001/2. Taxa that decreased in abundance due to the floods included the Gammaridae (Gammarus fossarum) and Turbellaria (Crenobia alpina). Taxa that increased in abundance included Baetidae, Chironomidae, and Simuliidae. Some Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Heptageniidae that were negatively impacted by the floods in 2000, subsequently increased in abundance. Our data suggest that the response of macroinvertebrates to experimental floods occurs over a period of years rather than months, as species composition adjusts to the new and more variable habitat template. Future changes are expected as additional species begin to colonize the river from adjacent sources. The results clearly show that the experimental flood regime should be maintained if resource managers wish to sustain the development of a more natural macroinvertebrate assemblage.},

  abstract = {The "restricted-movement paradigm" (RMP) states that adult fish in streams are sedentary and spend most of their lives in short (20-50 m) reaches of stream. In mark-recapture studies, however, many fish initially marked are often never recaptured. As well, turnover rates of individuals in the home section (where fish were originally marked) can be high when marked fish moving out are rapidly replaced by unmarked ones. Recent challenges to the RMP have been based on the inference that high turnover indicates high mobility. However, when the home section is small many individuals may leave (high turnover) but not move far away (low displacement). I present two models for the frequency distribution of displacement distances: one represents populations as homogeneous ensembles with a single mobility parameter; the second represents populations as a mixture of stationary and mobile individuals. Both readily distinguish the turnover and displacement components of movement and show that high turnover rate is compatible with low displacement. The models were then fit to dispersal curves for six species of stream salmonids in 27 populations. Empirical estimates of turnover rate were high (median: 0.53), variable among populations (range: 0.15-0.78), but unrelated to displacement distance. Median displacement was {$<$}100 m for 24 populations and was typically {$<$}50 m. The proportion of mobile individuals was low in most populations (median: 19\%) and exceeded 50\% in only five of the populations. Brook trout, a species central to studies critical of the RMP, appeared to be exceptionally mobile relative to other salmonids. The compatibility of high turnover rates with short displacement distances and the finding that median displacement was usually limited support the notion that restricted movement is the norm in populations of stream salmonids during nonmigratory periods. However, the finding of considerable intra- and interspecific heterogeneity in the extent of movement underscores the potential importance of the mobile component to population processes. By providing an analytical framework that yields quantitative measures of different components of movement and allows for standardized comparisons, these models can bring needed rigor to analysis and design in movement studies.},

  abstract = {Density-dependent processes such as growth, survival, reproduction and movement are compensatory if their rates change in response to variation in population density (or numbers) such that they result in a slowed population growth rate at high densities and promote a numerical increase of the population at low densities. Compensatory density dependence is important to fisheries management because it operates to offset the losses of individuals. While the concept of compensation is straightforward, it remains one of the most controversial issues in population dynamics. The difficulties arise when going from general concepts to specific populations. Compensation is usually quantified using some combination of spawner--recruit analysis, long-term field monitoring or manipulative studies, and computer modelling. Problems arise because there are limitations to each of these approaches, and these limitations generally originate from the high uncertainty associated with field measurements. We offer a hierarchical approach to predicting and understanding compensation that ranges from the very general, using basic life-history theory, to the highly site-specific, using detailed population models. We analyse a spawner--recruit database to test the predictions about compensation and compensatory reserve that derive from a three-endpoint life-history framework designed for fish. We then summarise field examples of density dependence in specific processes. Selected long-term field monitoring studies, manipulative studies and computer modelling examples are then highlighted that illustrate how density-dependent processes led to compensatory responses at the population level. Some theoretical and empirical advances that offer hope for progress in the future on the compensation issue are discussed. We advocate an approach to compensation that involves process-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms, life-history theory, careful analysis of field data, and matrix and individual-based modelling. There will always be debate if the quantification of compensation does not include some degree of understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Energy metabolism fuels swimming and other biological processes. We compared the swimming performance and energy metabolism within and across eight freshwater fish species. Using swim tunnel respirometers, we measured the standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and calculated the critical swimming speed (Ucrit). We accounted for body size, metabolic traits, and some morphometric ratios in an effort to understand the extent and underlying causes of variation. Body mass was largely the best predictor of swimming capacity and metabolic traits within species. Moreover, we found that predictive models using total length or SMR, in addition to body mass, significantly increased the explained variation of Ucrit and MMR in certain fish species. These predictive models also underlined that, once body mass has been accounted for, Ucrit can be independently affected by total length or MMR. This study exemplifies the utility of multiple regression models to assess within-species variability. At interspecific level, our results showed that variation in Ucrit can partly be explained by the variation in the interrelated traits of MMR, fineness, and muscle ratios. Among the species studied, bleak Alburnus alburnus performed best in terms of swimming performance and efficiency. By contrast, pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus showed very poor swimming performance, but attained lower mass-specific cost of transport (MCOT) than some rheophilic species, possibly reflecting a cost reduction strategy to compensate for hydrodynamic disadvantages. In conclusion, this study provides insight into the key factors influencing the swimming performance of fish at both intra- and interspecific levels.},

We used 6 years of data combining tagging, mobile antenna tracking and recaptures of Salmo trutta in multiple small streams in the Lake Lucerne drainage area in Switzerland to evaluate the relative importance of different environmental and intrinsic factors affecting the efficiency of the method. Our study system and experimental design allowed us to accurately verify the continuous presence and survival of recaptured fish in the stream after tracking, which meant that we could estimate detection probability with high confidence. The mean detection probability of tagged trout was 43\%, but we found that fish length had a strong negative effect on detection probability, especially in males. Multivariate axes of stream environmental features did not predict efficiency but stream width alone was significantly positively correlated with efficiency. Additionally, stream temperature when tracking had a positive effect on fish detectability. Tag loss at recapture was globally rare ({$<$}8\%) but common in large postspawn females ({$>$}30\%). Based on the escape response of fish after detection, we could estimate the proportion of ghost tags, which reached a plateau of around 80\% 2 years after tagging. We finally showed that our models of tag loss, fish detection and escape response are needed to interpret detection events. Our results highlight that individual variation in detection probability and tag loss is high and has to be considered for analysis.},

  abstract = {Survival is often estimated from capture--recapture data using Cormack--Jolly--Seber (CJS) models, where mortality and emigration cannot be distinguished, and the estimated apparent survival probability is the product of the probabilities of true survival and of study area fidelity. Consequently, apparent survival is lower than true survival unless study area fidelity equals one. Underestimation of true survival from capture--recapture data is a main limitation of the method. We develop a spatial version of the CJS model that allows estimation of true survival. Besides the information about whether a specific individual was encountered at a given occasion, it is often recorded where the encounter occurred. Thus, information is available about the fraction of dispersal that occurs within the study area, and we use it to model dispersal and estimate true survival. Our model is formulated hierarchically and consists of survival, dispersal and observation submodels, assuming that encounters are possible anywhere within a study area. In a simulation study, our new spatial CJS model produced accurate estimates of true survival and dispersal behaviour for various sizes and shapes of the study area, even if emigration is substantial. However, when the information about dispersal is scarce due to low survival, low recapture probabilities and high emigration, the estimators are positively biased. Moreover, survival estimates are sensitive to the assumed dispersal kernel. We applied the spatial CJS model to a data set of adult red-backed shrikes (Lanius collurio). Apparent survival of males (c. 0{$\cdot$}5) estimated with the CJS model was larger than in females (c. 0{$\cdot$}4), but the application of the spatial CJS model revealed that both sexes had similar survival probabilities (c. 0{$\cdot$}6). The mean breeding dispersal distance in females was c. 700 m, while males dispersed only c. 250 m between years. Spatial CJS models enable study of dispersal and survival independent of study design constraints such as imperfect detection and size of the study area provided that some of the dispersing individuals remain in the study area. We discuss possible extensions of our model: alternative dispersal models and the inclusion of covariates and of a habitat suitability map.},

  abstract = {Organismal movement is ubiquitous and facilitates important ecological mechanisms that drive community and metacommunity composition and hence biodiversity. In most existing ecological theories and models in biodiversity research, movement is represented simplistically, ignoring the behavioural basis of movement and consequently the variation in behaviour at species and individual levels. However, as human endeavours modify climate and land use, the behavioural processes of organisms in response to these changes, including movement, become critical to understanding the resulting biodiversity loss. Here, we draw together research from different subdisciplines in ecology to understand the impact of individual-level movement processes on community-level patterns in species composition and coexistence. We join the movement ecology framework with the key concepts from metacommunity theory, community assembly and modern coexistence theory using the idea of micro--macro links, where various aspects of emergent movement behaviour scale up to local and regional patterns in species mobility and mobile-link-generated patterns in abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. These in turn influence both individual movement and, at ecological timescales, mechanisms such as dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, and niche partitioning. We conclude by highlighting challenges to and promising future avenues for data generation, data analysis and complementary modelling approaches and provide a brief outlook on how a new behaviour-based view on movement becomes important in understanding the responses of communities under ongoing environmental change.},

  abstract = {The stream continuum concept suggests that the physical structure of the stream channel coupled with the hydrological cycle and energy inputs results in a consistent pattern of community structure and function along a stream. I evaluated this concept in a headwater fish community along two physical gradient gradients: upstream to downstream and riffle to pool. Habitat diversity and volume increased from upstream to downstream, and from riffle to pool. Temporal variation in habitat diversity was greater upstream. Upstream, and in riffles, habitat volume tended to vary more with time. Fluctuations in rainfall regime caused annual variation in habitat, especially in volume. Benthic insect density was highest from autumn (October-November) through spring (May-June). Following emergence of adults in late spring, invertebrate densities were low in summer in areas with riparian vegetation, but were not lower where riparian vegetation was absent and stable substrates were present. Along a gradient of substrates from silt-sand to gravel-rock, insect production increased, as indicated by adults and pupae in the drift. Peak resource availability for insectivore-piscivore fishes occurred in late summer and autumn, due to increased abundance of young-of-the-year fish. Pool and raceway-pool habitat guilds and insectivore and insectivore-piscivore trophic guilds contained the largest number of species. Increases in species richness were primarily associated with the addition of deeper habitats. Species richness of the pool insectivore-piscivore guild was especially variable over time. Biomass in shallow areas consisted predominantly of generalized insectivores. In deep, stable habitats, generalized insectivores were replaced as the predominant trophic group by insectivore-piscivores and large benthic insectivores. Immigration of fish occurred in spring and autumn, the periods of highest resource availability. Immigration between midriver and headwater regions primarily involved older age classes (III+), and was associated with changes in flow regime, habitat structure, and seasonal dynamics of the resource base of particular trophic groups. Flow regime and habitat volume appeared to be important factors limiting immigration in autumn, especially in pool species. Habitat diversity (depth, current, and substrate; DCS) was significantly correlated with fish species diversity (FSD). However, considerable variation occurred in the relationship between the two variables, including: (1) FSD decreased in winter in shallow, less diverse habitats due to emigration, and increased in spring due to recolonization; (2) FSD increased in spring and autumn when resource availability increased; (3) FSD was least predictable from DCS in autumn, when flow regimes were low and large numbers of fish recruits were present; and (4) DCS did not predict FSD as accurately in temporally variable upstream areas where large numbers of small fish dominated the community, especially in areas with human disturbance. Young age groups (0-II) were primarily found in shallow, temporally variable areas upstream and in riffles. Relative growth rates were highest during summer months. However, growth rates did not increase as much between spring and summer as would have been predicted from the seasonal increase in water temperature, suggesting that resource limitation may have occurred during summer periods. Centrarchids had substantially higher growth rates than cyprinids during early life stages. Net production for age 0-II fish was highest in upstream and riffle areas because of high densities of young, generalized insectivores. Net production of insectivore-piscivores was highest in downstream and pool habitats. Development of large, stable pools and raceways resulted in decreased fish production due to shifts in age structure toward fewer, large individuals with slower relative growth rates (age III+). Temporal variation in reproductive success and survival of younger age groups (0-I) was associated with random variation in high flow regimes and appeared to be a major factor determining spatial and temporal variation in production. These patterns of fish community structure and function support the qualitative aspect of the stream continuum concept: consistent shifts in community organization are associated with spatial or temporal changes in channel morphology and resource availability. However, for the stream continuum concept to be useful as a quantitative predictor, the ultimate mechanism(s) regulating fish community organization need to be more rigorously established. I hypothesize that in upstream or riffle areas, where younger age classes predominate, recolonization dynamics, the effect of gradual changes in physical conditions on competitive interactions, and temporal variation in reproductive success, are more important than competitive exclusion and predation as determinants of community organization.},

Using a field experiment focusing on a system of Mediterranean grasslands, we show that interspecific competition may influence the two components in the same direction or in opposite directions, depending on whether competitive exclusions are deterministic or stochastic. Deterministic exclusions reduce both patch-scale richness and beta-diversity, thereby homogenising the community. Stochastic extinctions reduce richness at the patch scale, but increase the differences in species composition among patches. These results indicate that studies of competitive effects on beta diversity may help to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic components of competitive exclusion. Such distinction is crucial for understanding the causal relationship between competition and species diversity, one of the oldest and most fundamental questions in ecology.},

Data on changes in the physical character of the stream, the fish population, and the bottom food supply also are presented for 1 year before and 3 years after installation of deflectors. The methods used to measure these various changes are given. Installation of 24 pool-forming deflectors raised the number of good pools from 9 to 29, increased the average pool depth by 6 inches, and exposed additional gravel without significantly changing the average stream depth over the entire section. Preliminary and unpublished bottom-food studies indicated a decrease in total number and volume of all organisms but an increase in forms found most frequently in trout stomachs. Fish-population studies demonstrated slight increases in the number of smaller trout present after the addition of deflectors, attended by a slight decrease in average size. Average creel-census figures for the 3 years prior to stream improvement and the 5 years after show an increase after improvement of 120 percent in the total catch and of 46 percent in pounds caught per hour coincident with a 64 percent increase in angling pressure. It was demonstrated that migration into the section improved was not responsible for the increases noted, also that bordering sections failed to have fishing comparably good to that produced in the improved section. It was concluded that the improvement in brook trout fishing in the experimental section was the result of an increase in number, size, and depth of pools created by installation of current deflectors.}

Although these assembly processes act in concert to structure local communities, their relative importance is considerably variable among study systems. While such contingency of community assembly has been widely appreciated, the empirical and theoretical evidence is scattered around in the literature, and few efforts have been made to synthesize it. In this mini-review, we summarize the accumulated evidence of the context-dependency of community assembly rules, to reach a rough generalization of the contingency. Specifically, we argue that spatial and temporal dimensions can serve as general axes that regulate the relative importance of assembly processes. To this end, we synthesize the current understanding of how the relative importance of multiple assembly processes changes with spatial scales and complexity, and with time in the long and short terms. This review concludes that spatial and temporal dimensions can be common currencies of community assembly rules that are shared across various systems.},

  abstract = {We consider four categories or biological mechanisms of determinants which cause and maintain species diversity: niche relations, habitat diversity, mass effects and ecological equivalency. Two of these determinants are original to this paper: mass effect, the establishment of species in sites where they cannot be self-maintaining; and ecological equivalency, the coexistence of species with effectively identical niche and habitat requirements. The mode of action and ecological implications of each biological determinant are discussed using a schematic method for measuring alpha (community), beta (differentiation), and gamma (regional) diversities. The importance of mass effects and ecological equivalency to species richess is documented with several types of field data from Israel and California, U.S.A. Floristic richness and, in particular, the richness of floristic transitions, are discussed and interpreted by use of the biological determinants of diversity. Contact transition between distinct floras are rich predominantly because of mass effects. Transitions induced by marked environmental changes are rich because of the combined influences of habitat diversity and mass effects. The rate at which species richness increases with sample area is related to the combined effects of all four biological determinants. This complexity explains the failures of simple species-area models. The relative intensity of each determinant is related to area: niche relations are most important at within-community scales, habitat diversity most important at both within-community and landscape scales, and ecological equivalency most important at regional scales. We suggest that understanding patterns of species diversity will be enhanced by the partitioning of total species richness into the richness caused by each of the four ecologically distinct determinants of diversity.},

The mean distance moved each month was positively correlated with monthly stream discharge, but the direction of movements was unpredictable. Patterns of movement varied considerably among individuals and appeared to be unrelated to size. Cod established home ranges of between 70 and 820\,m in length. Five of the tagged cod returned to a previous home range after moving more than 10\,km, whereas three did not move more than 2\,km from their capture location for the duration of the study. Cod used large woody debris complexes more than any other type of habitat, and rarely used areas of open water. Managers should give high priority to maintenance of fish passage and protection/rehabilitation of large woody debris habitats if cod populations are to recover.},

We tested this hypothesis with a unique data set sampled identically in 200 streams in two regions (tropical Brazil and boreal Finland) that differ in macroinvertebrate community size by fivefold. Null models allowed us to estimate the magnitude to which {$\beta$}-diversity deviates from the expectation under a random assembly process while taking differences in richness and relative abundance into account, i.e., {$\beta$}-deviation. We found that both abundance- and incidence-based {$\beta$}-diversity was negatively related to community size only in Brazil. Also, {$\beta$}-diversity of small tropical communities was closer to stochastic expectations compared with {$\beta$}-diversity of large communities. We suggest that ecological drift may drive variation in some small communities by changing the expected outcome of niche selection, increasing the chances of species with low abundance and narrow distribution to occur in some communities. Habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution, and reductions in connectivity have been reducing the size of biological communities. These environmental pressures might make smaller communities more vulnerable to novel conditions and render community dynamics more unpredictable. Incorporation of community size into ecological models should provide conceptual and applied insights into a better understanding of the processes driving biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Using a mark--recapture technique in a small temperate stream, we described the movement of four fish species over a five-month period and developed a mathematical model that described the observed movement patterns. The movement distributions were generally leptokurtic, and two of the four species demonstrated some degree of upstream bias. There was little difference in movement among species or through time. There were no temporal correlations in probability of movement, movement direction, or distance moved. The spatial spread of the most abundant species, bluehead chubs, over a four-month period was characterized by upstream bias, diffusion-like spread, and persistent leptokurtosis. Bluehead chubs demonstrated complex relationships between probability of movement and size and growth, while creek chubs showed only an effect of size on probability of movement. Further, growth of individual bluehead chubs was correlated through time. These empirical results suggest the hypothesis that heterogeneity in phenotypic attributes, such as size and growth, is related to heterogeneity in movement behavior. A diffusion--advection model of bluehead chub movement, structured with two subgroups that dispersed at different rates (``fast fish'' and ``slow fish''), was parameterized and validated with the field data. This model with heterogeneity in movement rates generated the leptokurtic pattern observed in the field data, in contrast to the classic diffusion model without population heterogeneity, which produces a normal distribution. The results from this work suggest that heterogeneity in fitness-influencing attributes such as size and growth could explain heterogeneity in individual-level movement behavior and might underlie the leptokurtic patterns that have been observed at the population level in numerous field studies.},

Here, we compare habitat unit--scale abundance estimates of PIT-tagged juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and steelhead O. mykiss derived from multiple-pass surveys with a submersible pole-mounted PIT antenna and backpack electrofishing in a small coastal California stream. We found high concordance of methods for coho salmon and age-0 steelhead and moderate concordance for age-1 and older steelhead. Regression analysis of PIT antenna estimates on electrofishing estimates indicated an approximately one-to-one relationship between methods. Regression intercepts for coho salmon and age-0 steelhead were significantly greater than zero, but the differences were small (with an effect equivalent to less than one fish). We found no evidence that pool area, cover area, or cover complexity influenced the relationship between methods for coho salmon and age-0 steelhead, but some evidence that electrofishing may be more effective than PIT antennas for estimating the abundance of age-1 and older steelhead in pools with high cover complexity. Our results demonstrate that surveys using submersible PIT antennas can provide habitat unit--scale estimates of juvenile salmonid abundance similar to those derived from electrofishing in small streams. An advantage of using PIT antennas is that they allow fish abundance estimation without fish recapture and frequent sampling can occur without subjecting study animals to excessive handling stress or mortality. This is a particularly important consideration in studies of small populations, sensitive species, or fish listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

  abstract = {The structure and function of streams is of critical importance to salmonid populations. The structure of streams is related to the amount and complexity of cover. Drift feeding salmonids use cover for a variety of reasons, but a primary reason is as velocity shelter. Fish choose focal positions near cover with low average velocities near stream regions with fast water velocities. Of all the variables that influence stream dwelling salmonids current velocity is considered to be of prime importance. Velocity is typically reported as average values, but riverene flows are turbulent for the vast majority of cases. Turbulence arises from shear on the bed and around large roughness elements, both regions preferentially occupied by young salmonids. The association between turbulence, cover and salmonid habitat occupancy provides an opportunity to use turbulence to better define habitat requirements. A combination of laboratory and field studies were conducted using high and low frequency velocity meters to document the turbulent velocity fluctuations at the focal point of young salmonids, their response to turbulent flow, and the relation between habitat complexity and habitat use. It was found that fish select focal points characterized by low turbulence, but that turbulence is a good predictor of the occurrence of young salmonids. These results appeared to be contradictory. Fish selected low turbulence focal positions, but selected focal positions near turbulence producing cover. This contradictory response was explained through the introduction of the turbulent attraction and avoidance (TAA) hypothesis. This hypothesis states that fish use turbulence produced from shear to navigate to locations in proximity to cover. Once there, focal positions are chosen that minimize exposure to turbulence produced from the cover. Another application of this work is in the field of hydraulic habitat modeling. Existing models do not predict potential focal positions or rearing densities with any consistency. Hydraulic habitat models are an important tool, and their use will likely increase. Therefore improvements in the ability of these models to realistically portray salmonid habitat use is critical, and the use of turbulence related habitat descriptions have the potential to improve the efficacy of these models.},

Typically, macroecologists explain the large-scale patterns of abundance, distribution and diversity. Despite the difficulties in sampling and characterizing microbial diversity, macroecologists have recently also been interested in unicellular organisms. Here, I review the current advances made in microbial macroecology, as well as discuss related ecosystem functions. Overall, it seems that microorganisms suit surprisingly well to known species abundance distributions and show positive relationship between distribution and adundance. Microbial species--area and distance--decay relationships tend to be weaker than for macroorganisms, but nonetheless significant. Few findings on altitudinal gradients in unicellular taxa seem to differ greatly from corresponding findings for larger taxa, whereas latitudinal gradients among microorganisms have either been clearly evident or absent depending on the context. Literature also strongly emphasizes the role of spatial scale for the patterns of diversity and suggests that patterns are affected by species traits as well as ecosystem characteristics. Finally, I discuss the large role of local biotic and abiotic variables driving the community assembly in unicellular taxa and eventually dictating how multiple ecosystem processes are performed. Present review highlights the fact that most microorganisms may not differ fundamentally from larger taxa in their large-scale distribution patterns. Yet, review also shows that many aspects of microbial macroecology are still relatively poorly understood and specific patterns depend on focal taxa and ecosystem concerned.},

The prevalence of dispersal in rapidly expanding populations is held to be the best evidence for presaturation dispersal. Because dispersal reduces the growth rate of source populations, it is generally believed that emigration is not balanced by immigration, and that mortality of emigrants occurs as a result of movement into a 'sink' of unfavourable habitat. If such dispersal is age- or sex-biased, the demo graphy of the population is markedly affected, as a consequence of differ ences in mortality in the dispersive sex or age class. Habitat heterogeneity consequently underlies this interpretation of dispersal and its demographic consequences, although the spatial variability of environments is rarely assessed in dispersal studies.},

  abstract = {(1) It has been suggested (e.g. by Hassell, Southwood \& Reader 1987) that spatial density dependence can be an important cause of temporal density dependence and stability, while at the same time making these effects difficult to detect in the field. In particular, these authors claim that spatially density-dependent mortality stabilizes a discrete-time single-species model, and that field populations failing to show temporal density dependence may be stabilized by such spatial density dependence. (2) We show that the single-species model of spatial density dependence due to De Jong (1979), and a variant of it used by Hassell, Southwood \& Reader (1987), are stable because they contain explicit temporal, as well as spatial, density dependence. Because of this, the models are stable even without spatial heterogeneity. (3) To obtain spatial density dependence without temporal density dependence, we derive a model differing from De Jong's only in making the fraction dying in a patch a function of the relative density, i.e. (density in the patch)/(average patch density for that generation), rather than the absolute density. Thus, mortality on a patch with the average density is the same in each generation. (4) Our model shows that spatial heterogeneity and density dependence can induce temporal density dependence and greater stability. When there is no heterogeneity, mortality is constant and our model becomes the null model of geometric growth or decline (or stasis, if fertility and mortality are exactly matched). When heterogeneity is added, our model yields a region of values of fertility and mortality (on a patch of average density) giving stability. (5) However, our model suggests that spatial heterogeneity is more likely to be destabilizing than stabilizing. Spatial density dependence introduces inverse temporal density dependence at low (and often all) densities. For the negative binomial distribution of patch densities and any given level of fertility, the mortality on a patch of average density must lie in a very small range if stability is to be possible, and this range shrinks steadily as clumping is increased. The range is negligible or non-existent for commonly observed values of the clumping parameter.},

  abstract = {Gulf sturgeon spawn on portions of three sites in the upper Suwannee River, which may appropriately be described as spawning reefs. The same areas are utilized from year to year. Habitat factors important in spawning site determination include gravel/cobble substrate, the presence of eddy fields, a neutral to slightly alkaline pH, and an empirically observed range in calcium ion content (6--18 mg/L Ca++, corresponding to a conductivity range of 40--110{$\mu$}S). Eggs are deposited contagiously within a small area ({$<$} 10,000 m2) with very little scatter, suggesting little if any current drift. They are not found from samplers on immediately adjacent sand substrate. The broadcast spawner model does not seem to fit the Gulf sturgeon. Spawning begins 4--7 days after the March new moon, with water temperature above 17.0 oC, and extends for 9--23 days as discrete events involving individual females. Spawning may continue, if water temperature remains below 21--22oC. The total annual pool of spawning females in the Suwannee population is estimated at 80 individuals. Young of the year utilize open sand habitat away from shoreline and vegetated habitat. They disperse widely, and occur over freshwater reaches from rkm 10--237; no particular affinity with spring water habitat is evident. Larger Gulf sturgeon tend to congregate in deep holes serving as summer-fall holding areas. They fast and lose weight while remaining in freshwater, but more than compensate this loss during winter feeding in marine waters. The major downriver migration to the estuary takes place in October-November. After a period of river mouth staging, subadults and adults migrate into Gulf of Mexico nearshore mesohaline waters. They move further out and into deeper water ({$>$} 3 m) when water temperatures drop in mid-December, but final destinations in mid-winter remain unknown. Age-2 through 6 juveniles remain in the river mouth estuary over winter. In late January through early February YOY migrate downriver for the first time, joining larger juveniles to overwinter and feed. Tag and recapture data yield a Suwannee River population of Gulf sturgeon estimated at 7,650 individuals, with an annual turnover rate of 16\%. Based on stability in cumulative recapture rates from 1991--1998, population size is stable with an effective balance between recruitment and mortality. However, population structure is dynamic, controlled by the juxtaposition, conjunction, and summation of successive strong and weak year classes. Length/age frequency distributions for 1995 and 1998 populations censuses are very different. The 1995 distribution is bimodal with a dominant mode of 9--14 year old subadults/adults, and a sub-dominant of mode of 2--4 year old juveniles. The 1998 distribution is trimodal, but overwhelmingly dominated by 6--9 year old subadults. Erosion by 1998 of the major subadult/adult mode from the 1995 census illustrates that large adults encounter the same high mortality as smaller fish. Ultimate adult size in the population has remained constant at 2.2 cm TL over 13 years, indicating a maximum life expectancy of 25 years for Suwannee River Gulf sturgeon.},

  abstract = {Site fidelity, the tendency to return to a previously occupied location, has been observed in numerous species belonging to at least three phyla. In this paper I develop a general model using dynamic programming to investigate conditions under which fidelity to a previously occupied territory will be advantageous. The results predict that site fidelity should be inversely related to heterogeneity in territory quality and the animal's lifespan and positively related to the cost of changing territories, age and probability of mortality in the habitat. The predictability of reproductive outcome (defined as the probability that next period's outcome will be the same as this period's outcome) also affects site fidelity. In predictable habitats, changing territories may be favoured after a bad previous outcome. In contrast, settlement should be independent of the previous outcome in unpredictable habitats. Individuals should also be site-faithful in unpredictable habitats, as long as the mean territory quality is equal among available territories. I also investigate the success of two potential decision rules (`always stay' and `win-stay: lose-switch') relative to the optimal settlement strategy. The results show that these rules may perform as well as the optimal strategy under certain conditions. The always stay strategy does well in unpredictable habitats, when the mean quality within a territory is equal among territories. In contrast, the win-stay: lose-switch strategy performs best in predictable habitats.},

  abstract = {Understanding how communities respond to environmental change is frustrated by the fact that both species interactions and movement affect biodiversity in unseen ways. To evaluate the contributions of species interactions on community growth, dynamic models that can capture nonlinear responses to the environment and the redistribution of species across a spatial range are required. We develop a time-series framework that models the effects of environment--species interactions as well as species--species interactions on population growth within a community. Novel aspects of our model include allowing for species redistribution across a spatial region, and addressing the issue of zero inflation. We adopt a hierarchical Bayesian approach, enabling probabilistic uncertainty quantification in the model parameters. To evaluate the impacts of interactions and movement on population growth, we apply our model using data from eBird, a global citizen science database. To do so, we also present a novel method of aggregating the spatially biased eBird data collected at point-level. Using an illustrative region in North Carolina, we model communities of six bird species. The results provide evidence of nonlinear responses to interactions with the environment and other species and demonstrate a pattern of strong intraspecific competition coupled with many weak interspecific species interactions.

  abstract = {Stream landscapes are highly variable in space and time and, like terrestrial landscapes, the resources they contain are patchily distributed. Organisms may disperse among patches to fulfill life-history requirements, but biotic and abiotic factors may limit patch or locality occupancy. Thus, the dynamics of immigration and extinction determine, in part, the local structure of assemblages. We sampled fishes and stream habitat at 12 localities for two years (96 samples) to examine the deterministic nature of immigration and extinction processes in stream fish assemblages. Mean immigration rates for assemblages were highest at large stream localities, where the pool of potential immigrants was largest. Mean extinction rates were highest where variability in the flow regime was high, though local refugia appeared to modify the extinction process at one locality. Significant nested subset patterns in species composition occurred over time for 7 of the 12 localities. The strength of the nesting was associated with mean immigration and extinction rates. Higher extinction rates corresponded to stronger nestedness, whereas higher immigration rates were associated with weaker nestedness. Across all species, both immigration and extinction rates were strongly associated with mean abundance. Species with high local abundances had higher immigration rates and lower extinction rates than did species with low local abundances. There were no significant associations between trophic guild or body size and immigration and extinction rate. This work supports the hypothesis that immigration and extinction rates for assemblages are predictable along environmental gradients, and that species are less prone to local extinction and more prone to colonize areas when they maintain high local abundances. The extinction process in local assemblages can be a highly ordered event leading to strong nested subset patterns, but immigration appears to be more stochastic.},

We examined movement patterns of Masu Salmon (Oncorhynchus masou masou), the obligate host fish for the freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera laevis, during the mussel's parasitic period to determine the dispersal potential of glochidia via host fish in the Shubuto River system, Hokkaido, Japan. We conducted a mark--recapture study in a 650-m river section to describe the distance and directionality of host fish movement, and we used fyke net sampling to quantify the number of host fish moving from mainstem rivers to tributaries. Most individuals of Masu Salmon captured in the study were infected with glochidia of M. laevis. The displacement distance of infected fishes ranged from 37.5 m downstream to 512.5 m upstream (mean = 36.5 m upstream from marking location). The dispersal kernel based on a diffusion--advection model represented a leptokurtic distribution with a fat-tailed upstream bias, but most recaptured fish remained near the initial capture location. Movement of fish from mainstem rivers to tributaries was strongly affected by differences in water temperature among tributaries. Most individuals moved to cooler tributaries, but tributaries did not support populations of M. laevis. These results suggest that glochidial dispersal via host fish is important for local recruitment and upstream dispersal, but dispersal to tributaries may be a source of mortality for M. laevis.},

However, obtaining unbiased estimates of dispersal parameters from capture--recapture data is challenging because it is impossible to survey all possible range of dispersal in the field. There are several approaches to address this critical issue of capture--recapture methods. Still, a lack of formal comparisons among these modeling approaches has confused about which is the best practice given the available dataset. Here, I compared the performance of three dispersal models using test datasets simulated under various sampling designs. In the first approach, a probability distribution (a dispersal kernel) was simply fitted to the capture--recapture data (the ``simple dispersal model''). In the second approach, a truncated probability distribution was used to account for the finite range of observations (the ``truncated dispersal model''). Finally, the dispersal and observation processes were coupled to consider the spatial organization of sampling designs (the ``dispersal--observation model''). The simulation study provided three important insights. First, the dispersal--observation model provided reliable estimates of dispersal parameters, even under sampling designs with a few recaptures. Second, the truncated dispersal model was also effective, but only when the number of recaptures was large. Finally, the use of the simple dispersal model caused a substantial underestimation of dispersal parameters regardless of sampling designs; this modeling approach should be avoided where possible. The results of this simulation study should help choose a suitable modeling approach.},

  abstract = {Although the prevailing paradigms in spatial ecology have treated dispersal as a stochastic process, there is an increasing awareness that spatial processes are non-random such that individual characteristics and ecological contexts influence dispersal. Natural disturbance, such as river flooding, is known to stimulate dispersal behaviour, but its interactive effects with individual-level characteristics (e.g. body size) of potential dispersers remain elusive. It is critical to fill this knowledge gap because anthropogenic impacts (including climate change) alter both disturbance regimes and population structures. Here, we examined how extreme high flows and individual body size combined to influence dispersal of three fishes (creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus, bluehead chub Nocomis leptocephalus, and striped jumprock Moxostoma rupicartes) in two streams (740 and 520 m long) in South Carolina, U.S.A. We focused on extreme high flows as a natural disturbance, whereas body size was used as an individual-level characteristic of dispersers. A total of 5,604 individuals were uniquely marked in the two streams over a {$>$}2-year study period, during which sampling occurred every 2 months. The intensive capture--recapture study revealed differential effects of disturbance and body size among sympatric stream fishes. Extreme high flows increased dispersal of striped jumprock and creek chub, whereas body size influenced dispersal of striped jumprock with larger individuals traveling longer distances. Bluehead chub showed a complex dispersal response. That is, size-dependence in dispersal emerged only during high-flow periods. The results of this study build upon previous efforts by providing field-based evidence of how disturbance and individual characteristics (body size) combine to drive non-random dispersal and how it varies among sympatric species. This finding is important because metapopulations that are maintained by different non-random dispersal (i.e. externally or internally driven) may show varied sensitivities to human-induced environmental changes.},

However, current theories treat post-infection dispersal propensities as a fixed trait, and the plastic nature of host's responses to parasite infection has long been underappreciated. Here, we present a mark--recapture experiment in a single host--parasite system (larval parasites of the freshwater mussel Margaritifera laevis and its salmonid fish host Oncorhynchus masou masou) and provide, to our knowledge, the first empirical evidence that parasite infection induces size-dependent host dispersal in the field. In response to parasite infection, large fish become more dispersive, whereas small fish tend to stay at the home patch. The observed plasticity in dispersal is interpretable from the viewpoint of host fitness: expected benefits (release from further infection) may exceed dispersal-associated costs for individuals with high dispersal ability (i.e. large fish) but are marginal for individuals with limited dispersal ability (i.e. small fish). Indeed, our growth analysis revealed that only small fish hosts incurred dispersal costs (reduced growth). Strikingly, our simulation study revealed that this plastic dispersal response of infected hosts substantially enhanced parasite persistence and occupancy in a spatially structured system. These results suggest that dispersal plasticity in host species is critical for understanding how parasites emerge, spatially spread, and persist in nature. Our findings provide a novel starting point for building a reliable, predictive model for parasite/disease management.},

Fish communities often consist of discrete and nonrandom species assemblages. Stream fish communities are all structured none randomly in space. In a meta-community framework, local fish communities may be structured by both spatial and environmental factors. Most fish in small, stable streams are most probably habitat specialists that have evolved various morphological and behavioral adaptations to exploit specific habitat types. Over large geographical and habitat scales, environmental filtering and anthropogenic effects are generally the most important determinants of assemblage variability. Streams are important habitats, providing shelter and feeding opportunities for a wide range of organisms like fish, insects, plants, mollusks, birds and mammals. Fish community structure depends on biotic interactions and abiotic variables. Predation is a major determinant of ecological patterns in fresh water fish communities. Resource partitioning among fishes suggest that competition may play an important role in the local organization of communities. Most studies are based on field observations, and many suggest that niche segregation rather than competitive exclusion is the predominant outcome resulting from competitive interactions. Finally, we saw that, fish community composition was negatively affected by human impact, Climate change, introduction of exotic spices and tourism or sports on streams.},

Here, we first review the evidence for the effects of and the potential interplays between abiotic factors, biotic interactions with conspecifics and heterospecifics and phenotype on dispersal decisions. We then present an experimental test of these potential interplays, investigating the effects of density and interactions with conspecifics and heterospecifics on temperature-dependent dispersal in microcosms of Tetrahymena ciliates. We found significant differences in dispersal rates depending on the temperature, density and presence of another strain or species. However, the presence and density of conspecifics and heterospecifics had no effects on the thermal-dependency of dispersal. We discuss the causes and consequences of the (lack of) interplay between the different environmental dimensions and the phenotype for metacommunity assembly and dynamics.

  abstract = {The metacommunity concept has the potential to integrate local and regional dynamics within a general community ecology framework. To this end, the concept must move beyond the discrete archetypes that have largely defined it (e.g. neutral vs. species sorting) and better incorporate local scale species interactions and coexistence mechanisms. Here, we present a fundamental reconception of the framework that explicitly links local coexistence theory to the spatial processes inherent to metacommunity theory, allowing for a continuous range of competitive community dynamics. These dynamics emerge from the three underlying processes that shape ecological communities: (1) density-independent responses to abiotic conditions, (2) density-dependent biotic interactions and (3) dispersal. Stochasticity is incorporated in the demographic realisation of each of these processes. We formalise this framework using a simulation model that explores a wide range of competitive metacommunity dynamics by varying the strength of the underlying processes. Using this model and framework, we show how existing theories, including the traditional metacommunity archetypes, are linked by this common set of processes. We then use the model to generate new hypotheses about how the three processes combine to interactively shape diversity, functioning and stability within metacommunities.},

  abstract = {All organisms, especially terrestrial plants and other sessile species, interact mainly with their neighbors, but neighborhoods can differ in composition because of dispersal and mortality. There is increasingly strong evidence that the spatial structure created by these forces profoundly influences the dynamics, composition, and biodiversity of communities. Nonspatial models predict that no more consumer species can coexist at equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In contrast, a similar model that includes neighborhood competition and random dispersal among sites predicts stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited number of species on a single resource. Coexistence occurs because species with sufficiently high dispersal rates persist in sites not occupied by superior competitors. Coexistence requires limiting similarity and two---way or three---way interspecific trade---offs among competitive ability, colonization ability, and longevity. This spatial competition hypothesis seems to explain the coexistence of the numerous plant species that compete for a single limiting resource in the grasslands of Cedar Creek Natural History Area. It provides a testable, alternative explanation for other high diversity communities, such as tropical forests. The model can be tested (1) by determining if coexisting species have the requisite trade---offs in colonization, competition, and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules of propagules to determine if local species abundances are limited by dispersal, and (3) by comparisons of the effects on biodiversity of high rates of propagule addition for species that differ in competitive ability.},

Here David Tilman presents a theory of how organisms compete for resources and the way their competition promotes diversity. Developing Hutchinson's suggestion that the main cause of diversity is the feeding relations of species, this book builds a mechanistic, resource-based explanation of the structure and functioning of ecological communities. In a detailed analysis of the Park Grass Experiments at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in England, the author demonstrates that the dramatic results of these 120 years of experimentation are consistent with his theory, as are observations in many other natural communities. The consumer-resource approach of this book is applicable to both animal and plant communities, but the majority of Professor Tilman's discussion concentrates on the structure of plant communities. All theoretical arguments are developed graphically, and formal mathematics is kept to a minimum. The final chapters of the book provide some testable speculations about resources and animal communities and explore such problems as the evolution of "super species," the differences between plant and animal community diversity patterns, and the cause of plant succession.},

Observations were made 24 h/d in all seasons. Definite patterns of diel activity and habitat use were evident and were modified by seasonal changes in water temperature. Fish remained in restricted home ranges for most of the year but tended to disperse in spring when all of the radio-tagged fish left their home pool; 75\% returned during the same season. Equal numbers of fish moved upstream and downstream. However, the median distance moved upstream was greater. Intrapool movement of smallmouth bass peaked soon after sunrise and again after sunset in all seasons. Average intrapool movement was 120 m/d when water temperatures were lowest (4{$^\circ$}C) and 980 m/d when temperatures were highest (27.5{$^\circ$}C). In the warmer seasons, fish preferred logjams and root wads by day and increased their use of boulders at night. In cooler seasons, fish used boulders almost exclusively. Regardless of season, open water without cover was used most during the period just after sunrise but was never used in proportion to its availability. Boulders were the most preferred substrate, and gravel was the least preferred. Small mouth bass used intermediate depths the most and showed no daily or seasonal changes in depth preferences. Fish preferred velocities less than 0.2 m/s at all times of day and in all seasons. Movements in floods did not differ from those observed during normal discharges; however, single logs were selected in significantly greater proportion than logjams.},

We conducted a systematic literature search of research directed towards understanding factors that influence biodiversity in lotic habitats, published in 31 major ecological and freshwater science journals from 1981 to 2014. Our goal was to characterize emergent themes in research successes and identify important areas in need of study. We show an overwhelming taxonomic bias favoring studies of macroinvertebrates and fish, and a paucity in studies of other important groups such as bacteria and fungi. While most studies assessed habitat variables that affect diversity at a local scale, there has been a recent push to investigate regional drivers of beta and gamma diversity. Several factors were consistently found to be important drivers of diversity including local habitat type, hydrologic variables, disturbance, and stream morphometry. Others such as nutrients and chemical variables showed mixed support. Species interactions, dispersal, and evolutionary processes were rarely considered but show promise as fruitful areas for future study. We suggest that researchers should give increased attention to diversity drivers at different scales as well as take advantage of new molecular techniques to address questions regarding organismal diversity in streams.},

These included four rheophilic (fast-riffle, riffle/run, fast-generalist, and shallow-rheophilic) and three limnophilic guilds (pool/run, open-pool, and pool-cover) that were reasonably robust across two river segments and two years. Although simple-hydraulic, bottom-topographic, and turbulence variables all segregated fish habitat-use guilds, turbulence variables were redundant with simple-hydraulic variables, substratum use by limnophilic fishes was related to availability, and only one guild consistently selected high cover levels. At the family level, suckers, darters, and especially minnows were notable for occupying several habitat-use guilds, because of species differences in habitat preferences. Such formulation of guilds can simplify habitat-impact analyses in biodiverse, warmwater streams, via focus on habitat needs of guilds rather than on individual species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Dispersal is a key process in ecology, evolutionary and conservation biology. Studies like mark-release-recapture work, show patterns of movement, but do not provide insight into the behavioural mechanisms. We review and comment recent results on animal dispersal behaviour. Dispersal through a landscape can be realised in two different ways: as a by-product of routine movements associated with resource exploitation (like foraging or mate-searching) with high levels of returning, or, as special, fast and directed movements designed for displacement. We illustrate and discuss both classes of movements as behaviourally different types. These types of movement imply different assumptions and consequences. We point at potential biases of current studies (like mark-release-recapture studies) towards routine, explorative movements. A more accurate knowledge of the dispersal behaviour is important to model dispersal with more biological realism, but also to better understand evolutionary consequences (e.g. uncoupled evolution of routine and special movements) and conservation (e.g. relative importance of corridors). The contribution of routine movements to dispersal is expected to decline with habitat fragmentation. A species' mobility is not a static trait, but a multiple trait, the components of which may evolve rapidly. The possibility of uncoupled selection on routine movements and real dispersal movements remains to be evaluated. Yet, we are only at the beginning of understanding the behavioural ecology of dispersal movements. A more careful treatment of behavioural components of mobility within observational and experimental studies of animal dispersal is needed. Zusammenfassung Die Ausbreitung ist ein Schl{\"u}sselprozess der {\"O}kologie sowie der Evolutions- und Naturschutzbiologie. Untersuchungen wie Fang-Wiederfang-Arbeiten zeigen Muster der Bewegung, bieten jedoch keine Einsicht in die Verhaltensmechanismen. Wir geben einen {\"U}berblick und kommentieren neuere Ergebnisse zum Ausbreitungsverhalten der Tiere. Die Ausbreitung {\"u}ber eine Landschaft kann in zwei unterschiedlichen Weisen realisiert werden: als ein Nebenprodukt von Routinebewegungen mit einem hohen R{\"u}ckkehranteil, die mit der Ressourcennutzung assoziiert sind (wie Nahrungsaufnahme und Partnersuche), oder als spezialisierte, schnelle und gerichtete Bewegung zur Ortsver{\"a}nderung. Wir illustrieren und diskutieren beide Klassen der Bewegung als unterschiedliche Verhaltenstypen. Diese Typen der Bewegung implizieren unterschiedliche Annahmen und Konsequenzen. Wir weisen auf die potenzielle Ausrichtung aktueller Untersuchungen (wie Fang-Wiederfang-Untersuchungen) auf explorative Routinebewegungen hin. Ein genaueres Wissen um das Ausbreitungsverhalten ist wichtig, um die Ausbreitung mit gr{\"o}{\ss}erem biologischen Realismus zu modellieren, aber auch, um evolution{\"a}re Konsequenzen (nicht gekoppelte Evolution von Routine- und speziellen Bewegungen) und den Schutz (z. B. die relative Bedeutung von Korridoren) besser zu verstehen. Es wird erwartet, dass der Beitrag der Routinebewegungen zur Ausbreitung mit der Habitatfragmentierung abnehmen wird. Die Mobilit{\"a}t einer Art ist keine statische, sondern eine multiple Eigenschaft, deren Komponenten sehr schnell evolvieren k{\"o}nnten. Die M{\"o}glichkeit der nicht gekoppelten Selektion von Routinebewegung und echten Ausbreitungsbewegungen bleibt weiterhin zu erforschen. Noch sind wir am Beginn eines Verst{\"a}ndnisses der Verhaltens{\"o}kologie von Ausbreitungsbewegungen. Eine sorgf{\"a}ltigere Behandlung der Verhaltenskomponenten der Mobilit{\"a}t bei Beobachtungen und experimentellen Untersuchungen der Ausbreitung von Tieren ist notwendig.},

Projected effects of climate change and land alterations suggest headwater streams may become more intermittent and less predictable, consequently altering biological processes (i.e. dispersal or movement) that govern population dynamics. Few studies have provided insight into movement dynamics of nongame fishes in small headwater streams that commonly experience intermittent conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate movement of a fish species adapted to intermittent stream conditions. Our objectives were to (i) describe the general movement patterns of creek chub, Semotilus atromaculatus, in an intermittent stream and (ii) investigate which ecological factors may influence movement in patchy environments. Creek chub displayed some of the longest distances moved compared to many other stream fishes in perennial streams (179--1069 m seasonal averages; 4678 m maximum distance). Directional movement was significant only in May with more individuals moving upstream. The probability of creek chub movement was inversely related to habitat complexity and pool area. Creek chub adapted to intermittent stream conditions not only exhibited increases in the frequency and distance of movement compared to other nongame fishes, but also exhibited movements in relation to local habitat metrics. These results demonstrate some of the potential adaptations that are likely to promote the survival and persistence of populations in highly dynamic environments such as intermittent streams.},

Using mark--recapture, we examined movement patterns of southern redbelly dace, Chrosomus erythrogaster, in an intermittent Ozark stream having both permanently connected and temporally isolated sections. Juvenile (60--88\%) and adult (55--83\%) residency rates were not significantly different for any mark--recapture sample, and movement was primarily within a section for both groups. Ontogenetic differences were detected for kurtosis, distance moved and population spread, with adults exhibiting greater variability in movement, moving more often and further. When considering only adults, there was a significantly higher number of individuals that exhibited intermovement from isolated sections compared with connected sections. In addition, a higher proportion of adults exhibiting intermovement moved to connected stream sections in May and July compared to January and March. Dace exhibited upstream bias in July, with 76\% of emigrates moving to an upstream connected section. Although there were no statistically significant associations between the proportion of intermovers from connected and isolated sections and measured water quality and habitat variables, noteworthy trends were observed, and these trends were always stronger for connected sections.

They treat fisheries policy development as a two-stage process, first identifying strategies for varying harvest in relation to changes in abundance, then finding ways to implement such strategies in terms of monitoring and regulatory procedures. This book provides a general framework for developing assessment models in terms of state-observation dynamics hypotheses, and points out that most fisheries assessment failures have been due to inappropriate observation model hypotheses rather than faulty models for ecological dynamics.Intended as a text in upper division and graduate classes on fisheries assessment and management, this useful guide will also be widely read by ecologists and fisheries scientists.},

Size and lipid effect on the relationship between fin and muscle were also investigated. Dorsal muscle (DM) and fin clip (FC) were collected from A. sinensis with different body length (120--373 mm) in the Yangtze Estuary for isotope analysis. The result showed that (1) muscle isotope values could estimated by the values of fin, from either use the regression model ({$\delta$}13CDM = 0.939 {\texttimes} FC - 2.577; {$\delta$}15NDM = 0.737 {\texttimes} FC + 4.638) or constants factors ({$\delta$}13CDM = {$\delta$}13CFC - 1.27; {$\delta$}15NDM = {$\delta$}15NFC + 0.59); (2) no size-based relationships with {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N from either fin or muscle; (3) lipid extraction significantly improving the fin and muscle regression model fit for both {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values. Therefore, this study support the use of nonlethal fin tissues for isotope analysis of juvenile A. sinensis, and will allow trophic studies to avoid the effect of lipid accumulation from muscle.},

  abstract = {Intraspecific food competition exerts powerful selective forces on all animals; successful foragers thrive relative to weaker conspecifics. Understanding competition is therefore fundamental both to ecological insight and to conservation efforts. Fish are adaptable and tractable experimental organisms, offering excellent model systems for studies on competition, and they lend themselves to two approaches: (i) studies of short-term competition, which quantify the components of behavioural interactions; (ii) studies of long-term interactions, in which the indeterminate nature of fish growth makes it possible to measure rates directly and correlate them with competitive success. The nature and the intensity of competition vary according to resource characteristics and distributions in time and space, the ecological context, and the relative competitive abilities of the foragers. Second-order effects, such as winner and loser consequences, add to the complexity and frustrated early attempts to develop realistic models of intraspecific competition. Recently, however, considerable advances have been made in both laboratory and field studies on fishes adding to our understanding of these interacting effects. At the same time, the application of individual-based modelling offers the prospect of progress towards greater realism and accuracy in predicting competitive outcomes. This review draws together a wide and disparate literature on intraspecific competition in fishes to facilitate the work of both empiricists and theoreticians towards these important goals. In the short term, competing individuals may adopt different behavioural strategies and feeding patterns or establish dominance hierarchies and feeding territories. In the longer term, competition can drive character displacement and the formation of species pairs and fish provide some of the most compelling examples of these processes in evolutionary biology. The challenge for the future is to further develop our understanding of the relationship between the competitive environment and the responses of fishes, particularly with closer co-operation between empiricists and theoreticians, and to apply this knowledge to aquaculture and to better management of exploited fish stocks.},

The fairy basslet Gramma loreto (Grammatidae) lives in dominance hierarchies that occupy the undersides of open reef ledges in the Caribbean region. Each hierarchy is maintained by aggression between size classes such that larger fish occupy prime plankton-feeding positions closer to the outer edge of the ledge. We conducted a removal experiment in the central Bahamas to determine the role of larger fish in maintaining the hierarchy and the resultant consequences to smaller fish. When larger fish were removed, smaller individuals quickly occupied these prime feeding positions and were the recipients of less aggression compared to controls. As a result, the average feeding rates of smaller fish were more than 60\% higher in aggregations in which larger fish had been removed. Differences in feeding rates were the result of 2 types of competitive effects: between-position and within-position. The between-position effect was the result of differential feeding rates associated with different feeding positions within an aggregation. The within-position effect was due to interactions within a given feeding position. Although both effects strongly influenced basslet feeding rate, the magnitude of the within-position effect was roughly 3 times that of the between-position effect. Together, these 2 components of competition may affect demographic rates and ultimately contribute to local population regulation.},

  abstract = {The bluegill sunfish (Lepomis marcrochirus) in small ponds feeds on relatively large prey associated with the vegetation. However, in the presence of the green sunfish (L. cyanellus) it shifts to feeding on smaller, less preferred prey in the open water column. The mechanisms responsible for this habitat shift were examined by experimentally confining both species, alone and together, in homogeneous patches of the preferred habitat (vegetation). When confirmed together in the vegetation the green sunfish exhibited higher survivorship, growth rates, and amount of food in the stomachs that the bluegill. The bluegill fed on smaller items and consumed benthic prey than did the green sunfish. The presence of the congener did not alter the food habits of either species or the growth rates of the green sunfish in relation to species stocked alone. Presence of the congener did affect the growth rates of the bluegill. Overlap in the diet was 70\% when these species were confined to the vegetation as compared to 44\% in an earlier study where habitat separation was permitted. The green sunfish is more of a sit-and-wait predator and is able to utilize a wider food size spectrum than the bluegill. This results in a strong asymmetry in the competition function favoring the green sunfish in the vegetation. However, in the open water column the distribution of food sizes is truncated and this provides a competitive refuge for the bluegill which handles small foods more efficiently. The bluegill appears to be more flexible in its habitat use while the green sunfish is more aggressive and limited in the habitats utilized. Comparisons with studies of habitat shifts in salmonids suggest that the competitive mechanisms outlined are of general relevance in fish communities. Considerations of the relation between habitat structure, the correlated distribution of food sizes, and species morphology provides a framework for specifying the occurence of habitat shifts and which species of the interactive set will shift.},

  abstract = {Movement has been studied extensively in stream salmonids, and most data suggest that population-level behaviour is best described by a leptokurtic distribution. This distribution emphasises the large proportion of sedentary individuals in a population, which can implicitly lead to assumptions of low population connectivity and overlook the ecological significance of rare individuals with more mobile phenotypes. We report findings of a multi-season radio telemetry study conducted on four adjacent populations of wild brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) connected by Loyalsock Creek in north-central Pennsylvania. We used these data to investigate temporal and spatial patterns in movement and fitness trade-offs associated with behavioural phenotype. Similar to previous studies, we found that 59 of the 120 radio-tagged individuals (49\%) were sedentary and moved less than 200 m. Only 18\% of individuals dispersed more than 1 km, but the maximum distance moved exceeded 13 km. We also found that mobile individuals had significantly higher summer and autumn survival than did sedentary fish, which could indicate that there are fitness benefits associated with vagility. Most long-distance movements were the result of fish migrating from small tributaries into a larger mainstem river in the days after spawning. Therefore, even though mobility was only expressed for a short duration and by relatively few individuals in the population, the behaviour appears to maintain metapopulation connectivity throughout the catchment. Our study highlights the ecological significance of rare phenotypes for population demography across large spatial scales and the need to understand movement across multiple temporal and spatial scales to ensure adequate conservation of critical forms of cryptic life history diversity.},

Rapidly advancing geographical information systems (GIS) technologies are forcing a careful evaluation of the roles and biases of landscape and traditional site-based perspectives on assessments of aquatic communities. Viewing the world at very different scales can lead to seeming contradictions about the nature of specific ecological systems. In the case of Michigan trout streams, landscape analyses suggest a predictable community shaped by large-scale patterns in hydrology and geology. Most site-based studies, however, suggest these communities are highly variable in structure over time, and are strongly shaped by site-specific physical and biological dynamics. As the real world is comprised of processes operating both at local and landscape scales, an analytical framework for integrating these paradigms is desirable. 2. Decomposition of variances by factorial ANOVA into time, space and time--space interaction terms can provide a conceptual and analytical model for integrating processes operating at landscape and local scales. Using this approach, long-term data sets were examined for three insects and two fishes common in Michigan trout streams. Each taxon had a unique variance structure, and the observed variance structure was highly dependent upon sample size. 3. Both spatially extensive designs with little sampling over time (typical of many GIS studies) and temporally extensive designs with little or no spatial sampling (typical of population and community studies), are biased in terms of their view of the relative importance of local and landscape factors. The necessary, but in many cases costly, solution is to develop and analyse data sets that are both spatially and temporally extensive.},

Here, we examine the utility of fish dorsal fin membrane as an alternative to muscle for analyzing {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N ratios in two reef fish species (blue cod Parapercis colias and spotty Notolabrus celidotus) that have differing feeding modes. Both species exhibited evidence of size-based feeding from fin {$\delta$}15N values, but not from muscle. Blue cod fin {$\delta$}15N increased steadily throughout the sampled size range (213--412~mm fork length), whereas spotty exhibited a distinct ontogenetic diet shift at approximately 120--140~mm fork length after which size-based feeding did not occur. Fin membrane was higher than muscle in {$\delta$}13C in both species and in {$\delta$}15N for blue cod, but fin {$\delta$}15N was lower than muscle in spotty. The {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N fin--muscle offsets were constant in spotty regardless of size, while in blue cod, {$\delta$}13C was constant with fish size, but {$\delta$}15N offsets increased with increasing fish size. Non-lethal sampling utilizing fin tissue can be employed to estimate stable isotope values of muscle in fishes, but it is necessary to assess relationships among tissues and the effects of fish size on isotope values a priori for each species studied. Our data indicated that fin membrane may be a more sensitive tissue than muscle for detecting size-based feeding in some fish species using stable isotopes. A critical literature review revealed inconsistencies in tissue types tested, little understanding of tissue-specific trophic shift or turnover rates, and pseudo-replicated analyses leading to erroneous postulating of 1:1 relationships between tissues.},

Patches are physically identical and differ only in the initial proportion of species that colonize the patches.

After a period of interaction, individuals from all patches join in global pool of dispersers that colonize a new @'generation@' of patches. Complex interactions can have at least two important effects on metacommunity dynamics. First the number of species coexisting in the metacommunity can greatly exceed the number of species coexisting in any single patch, despite the fact that the patches are physically identical, the species do not differ in colonization ability, and stochastic effects are absent after the colonization stage. Second, complex interactions provide a new source of variation upon which natural selection can operate at the patch level, providing a mechanism for the evolution of functionally organized communities.},

All nine species exhibited peak reproduction during the early wet season and a similar sequence of size-dependent shifts from a diet composed primarily of microcrustacea, to aquatic insects, and finally fishes. Three piranha species specialized on fish fins, particularly at subadult size classes (SL 30--80 mm). Gradual dessication of the floodplain during the transition season was associated with fish growth, increased fish density, and decreased aquatic primary productivity and availability of invertebrate prey. Based on 118 resource categories, average pairwise diet overlap was low during all three seasons: wet, transition, and dry. Of 72 species pairings, only one pair of fin-nipping piranhas exhibited high overlap simultaneously on three niche dimensions: food type, food size, and habitat. Adults of two species, a gymnotid knifefish and pimelodid catfish, were largely nocturnal. Patterns of habitat utilization indicate that piranhas may restrict diurnal use of the open-water region by other piscivores. Collective diet overlap of individual piscivore species with the other eight feeding guild members and collective overlaps with the entire fish community each revealed two basic seasonal trends. Four species that showed an early switch to piscivory also showed a high degree of diet separation with both the guild and community at large on a year-round basis. The five remaining species showed lowest collective diet overlaps during the transition season when availability of invertebrates was reduced and fish densities were maximal. Whereas predation may play a role in habitat separation, diffuse competition for food resources during the approximately four-month transition season probably is the principal factor yielding patterns of diet specialization.},

  abstract = {Objective In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, climate change is increasing air temperatures, decreasing warm season (April--September) streamflow, and increasing cool season (October--March) streamflow. Warmer water temperatures may alter conditions for migratory coldwater fishes like the Bull Trout Salvelinus confluentus. Consequently, an understanding of Bull Trout migration and survival is critical for species conservation and restoration. In the Salmon River basin, Idaho, 1992 and 1993 transpired to be two of the most opposing extreme years among the past three decades for warm season water temperature and streamflow. These extremes provided a unique opportunity to retrospectively compare Bull Trout survival and migration under potential climate change scenarios. Methods We evaluated prespawning and postspawning migrations and survival of fluvial Bull Trout that were radio-tagged and tracked from 1992 to 1994. We used a Cormack--Jolly--Seber linear spatial capture--recapture model to simultaneously model the migration and survival of radio-tagged prespawn (n = 58) and postspawn (n = 23) Bull Trout among weeks and river reaches with streamflow, water temperature, and habitat covariates. Result Most individual prespawning migrations were similar among tagged fish, whereas postspawn fish adopted multiple migration and overwintering strategies. Movements of prespawn Bull Trout were larger when (1) weekly average daily maximum streamflow increased and (2) weekly average daily maximum water temperature increased. The model estimated that at least 52\% of spawners survived to spawning, and mean weekly prespawning apparent survival was higher in the low-streamflow year (1992) than in the year with higher and more variable streamflow (1993). Survival of 1992--1994 fish during the 38-week postspawning period was intermediate to that in the prespawning period. Detections of prespawn Bull Trout were generally higher at sites with more complex habitats, less large woody debris, and fewer undercut banks. Conclusion We found that the prespawn life stage can represent a shorter time frame (14--18 weeks) with increased mortality compared to the longer postspawning period (38 weeks). Bull Trout apparent survival increased with lower streamflow variability, indicating that expected future changes in climate may adversely affect Bull Trout.},

However, more common day-to-day behaviors, such as foraging, are often assumed to have little effect on dispersal at larger scales (tens to thousands of kilometers). In this review, we (1) place foraging within the context of current knowledge on behaviors that influence dispersal and transport, (2) provide evidence for foraging behavior as a driving mechanism of distributions, and (3) present a meta-analysis of dispersal distances estimated for three dispersal hypotheses (passive, swimming directly against currents, and foraging behavior) from 59 studies that document oceanographic conditions and in situ organism distributions. Results of the analyses reveal that when foraging and aggregative behaviors are considered, dispersal distances for larvae and zooplankton could be hundreds of kilometers less than many current dispersal estimates. Reduced transport because of foraging implies that individual populations might be more isolated than currently accepted. These findings suggest that fine-scale organism behaviors should be considered in models aimed to improve conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {Although metacommunity models generally formulate dispersal as a random, passive process, mounting evidence suggests that dispersal can be an active process depending on species fitness over the landscape, particularly in multitrophic communities. How different dispersal modes (i.e. from random to increasingly fitness-dependent dispersal) modulate the effect of dispersal on biodiversity remains unclear. Here, we used a metacommunity model of food webs to investigate the effects of dispersal and habitat heterogeneity on biodiversity and how these effects may be dependent on dispersal mode. Our results showed that compared to isolated systems, random dispersal increased local food web diversity ({$\alpha$} diversity) but decreased across-community dissimilarity ({$\beta$} diversity) and regional food web diversity ({$\gamma$} diversity), consistent with findings from competitive metacommunity models. However, fitness-dependency could alter the effects of dispersal on biodiversity. Both {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} diversity increased with the strength of fitness-dependency of dispersal, while {$\alpha$} diversity peaked at intermediate fitness-dependency. Notably, strong fitness-dependent dispersal maintained levels of {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} diversity similar to those observed in isolated systems. Thus, random dispersal and isolation (i.e. no dispersal) can be considered as two extremes along the continuum of fitness-dependent dispersal, in terms of their effects on biodiversity. Moreover, both biodiversity-habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity-habitat connectivity relationships depended on the dispersal mode. Strikingly, under random dispersal, {$\gamma$} diversity decreased with habitat heterogeneity and connectivity, but under strong fitness-dependent dispersal, it increased with habitat heterogeneity and remained unchanged as habitat connectivity increased. Our study highlights the context dependence of dispersal effects on biodiversity in heterogeneous landscapes. Our findings have useful implications for biodiversity conservation and landscape management, where management strategies should account for different modes of dispersal across taxa, thus different responses of biodiversity to habitat heterogeneity and connectivity.},

  abstract = {Understanding consumer--resource interactions is essential for understanding the trophic dynamics of species-rich fish communities. Woodland et al. (Oikos 125:556--565, 2016) assumed that trophic position (TP) distributions of primary consumers and tertiary species are restricted versus intermediate consumers tending to be omnivores with broader TP distribution, where these omnivores often dominate the overall biomass. With rare evidence supporting this hypothesis in a river, we tested it in the species-rich Pearl River fish assemblage, China. Using bulk stable isotope (SI) approach ({$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}15N), the TPs, SI distribution parameters, isotopic niche sizes (as standard ellipse areas, SEA) and interspecific niche overlap were calculated for the abundant fish species. Fishes of intermediate TPs (i.e. omnivores) had larger {$\delta$}13C variance/ range, broader isotopic niches and higher niche overlap compared to fishes at low TPs and high TPs, indicating a higher degree of trophic redundancy among the omnivores, whereas high TP fish had narrower niche and lower niche overlap, indicating trophic partitioning among tertiary species. These omnivores at intermediate TPs between 2.4 and 2.8 dominated fish biomass. The results not only support the Woodland et al. (Oikos 125:556--565, 2016) hypothesis in the river, but also provide a novel explaining in how niche sizes and overlap vary by TP.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessments of fish populations are often limited by re-observation or recapture events. Since the early 1990s, passive integrated transponders (PIT tags) have been used to understand the biology of many fish species. Until recently, PIT applications in small streams have been limited to physical recapture events. To maximize recapture probability, we constructed PIT antenna arrays in small streams to remotely detect individual fish. Experiences from two different laboratories (three case studies) allowed us to develop a unified approach to applying PIT technology for enhancing data assessments. Information on equipment, its installation, tag considerations, and array construction is provided. Theoretical and practical definitions are introduced to standardize metrics for assessing detection efficiency. We demonstrate how certain conditions (stream discharge, vibration, and ambient radio frequency noise) affect the detection efficiency and suggest that by monitoring these conditions, expectations of efficiency can be modified. We emphasize the importance of consistently estimating detection efficiency for fisheries applications.}

  abstract = {The rate of somatic growth determines when individuals transition between life stages, which along with survival and reproduction, are principal factors governing the rate of population change. For short-lived species that inhabit seasonally dynamic environments, accounting for fluctuations in somatic growth is necessary to make reliable inferences about population dynamics. We describe a Bayesian, state-space formulation of a von Bertalanffy growth model that integrates a sinusoidal model to allow for seasonal fluctuations in growth while also accounting for individual heterogeneity and measurement error. We use this model to describe post-metamorphic growth of canyon treefrogs, Hyla arenicolor, based on capture-recapture data from 404 individuals over a two-year period. For simulated data where we assumed growth varies seasonally, our model provides unbiased estimates of growth rate, mean asymptotic length, standard deviation of individual asymptotic lengths, and date of maximum growth. For field data from canyon treefrogs, we found strong evidence of seasonal variation in growth, with maximum growth during the summer monsoon season. Growth rate of females was 19 \% lower than males, although on average, females reached asymptotic lengths that were 15 \% greater than males. Ignoring systematic intra-annual variation in growth can bias inferences about population dynamics, particularly for fast-growing species that reproduce more than once per year or inhabit environments with strong seasonal signals. We present a straightforward approach for using repeated length measurements from individuals of unknown age to estimate growth while accounting for seasonality and individual heterogeneity, which are sources of variation common in many vertebrate populations.},
